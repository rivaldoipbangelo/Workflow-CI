my favourite movie ever,0
it was jurassic park,0
my brother is the guy who kept commenting attempt to get jeremy to review sam raimi s spider man number i remember when this video dropped he felt so happy for the shoutout,0
my nine year old self squealed in delight after seeing that original trailer on the big screen,0
,0
that upside down kiss tho,0
he speaks insanely fast i make the video on speed to be able to learn english form his videos but stunning channel,0
i noticed jeremy didnt give us a sample of the spiderman score that he loved as much as s m and b mans score was he just so overwhelmed by its quality that he just couldnt take doing it or was it just a bullshit prop to what is actualy a totaly inferior tune to the other two c mon eaual to supermans theme madness,0
toby maguire wasnt liked on set he was said to be a creep and a wierdo apparently the director told him if he wanted to be rehired fir the next movies he should stop walking around picking his nose and eating it,0
but saying if he had spider powers his web should shoot from his butt is like saying he should have eight legs and an overabundance of eyeballs,0
tid bit not tit bit people,0
i really did enjoy this movie and peter parker aka spiderman played by tobey maguire he did a great job in this movie and he was so good for this role and he was amazing as this character too and mary jane watson played by kirsten dunst she did a great job too as well and she was so awesome for this role and she is so beautiful and gorgeous too and i like her as a actress now and norman osborn aka the green goblin played by willem dafeo he did a great job as the main villain role for this foo and he was so awesome for this role and he did a very good in this movie too and harry osborn played by james franco he did a really good job too and he was so good for this movie role and he was so awesome for this role and it was nice to see him in this movie too and flash thompson played by joe manganiello he did a great job as the bully in this movie and he was awesome for this role but he was barely in this movie tho but it was cool to see him in this movie role tho and betty brant played by my girl elizabeth banks she did a great job too as well and she was so awesome for this role and she was so good for this movie too and she is so incredibly sexy as hell bro and she is so gorgeous too and i m a huge fan of her now love her to death man and finally j jonah jameson played by jk simmons he did a great job too and he was so good for this role and he was so funny in this movie too and can t believe it s been years now since this movie came out and that s insane it s been that many decades ago now and i was years old when i saw this movie came out and i was in nd grade when i saw this movie and i sure do missed those good old days back then too and time sure does flies in the movie world that s for sure jeremy bro and overall i m gonna give spiderman a stars i really did enjoyed this movie but didn t not like the ending that much but that s just me though in my opinions and thoughts on this movie jeremy jahns bro,0
deadpool wolverine trailer review,0
i remember after this movie came out like a year later a friend of mine used the whole green goblin mirror talking scene as an example of schizophrenia for health class,0
still waiting on that spider man review,0
they announced that year that the trailer would be attached to final fantasy the movie which was the only reason i saw that movie was for the spider man trailer,0
best spider man,0
this why i will always love teen age mutant ninja turtles movie from s,1
a little late,0
on the subject of the green goblin s eventually they will hate you speech on the roof with spider man while he is right and the films have proven it to be legit there is a counterargument scene to that in spider man with aunt may where she speaks of those who love heroes and the need to keep holding on a second longer and she too is right the truth is that while there will be those who will wish to tear down a hero like spider man there will be those who will be there to lift him up and have hope for him the thing is that those who want to tear him down will be louder sometimes and it can wear anyone down but when someone speaks up for the hero gives them the dose of hope they need it can be more powerful than any hatred spoken,0
after watching it again last night for the first time in years and my gf s first time watchibg it in its entirity its aged even better minus the cgi and mary jane character i guess because of how bad new superhero blockbusters are written and feel lifeless,0
the raimi spidey movies are on par with burton batman movies in my mind that s spider man and in my mind that s batman,0
you know in the scene where norman asks you know how much i sacrificed he used to scare me as a kid but now i pretty much look like him in that scene at least as far as looking like a clean shaven rasputin and it feels weird,0
i think the most fascinating thing about this video is that most people have seen it when this review was released but as time goes on less and less people checking this video will have seen it,0
i wonder where oh my god it s fucking spider man guy is now,0
i was born in,0
slpeder men is my favorite movie,1
spiderman,1
i love this movie it s one of those movies that i loved as a kid and i still love and i will always love i love the soundtrack they got the origin story of spider man right this is also one of those movies where when i watch it i discover something new anyway i love willem dafoe as norman osborn green goblin he was awesome his laugh his anger his motivation his insanity and his violence his suit however looked weird it looked like a power ranger outfit but his writing was great like the scene where he captured spider man and he was telling him that in spite of everything he s done for the city eventually they will hate him that final fight between spider man and green goblin was brutal green goblin beat the crap out of spider man i rewatched this movie in march it still holds up it s the perfect origin story of spider man a great introduction to spider man and a great superhero movie,0
epic review for an epic movie,1
well it s official the original spider man is now years old i m very very thankful i found the first trailer for it on resident evil dvd and my dad took my sister cara and i to see it opening weekend then we saw it again after made million domestically and million worldwide i m really blessed that sam raimi tobey maguire kirsten dunst willem dafoe and james franco brought these characters to life with a great story acting heart fun special effects music and bringing an impossible comic book to the screen amazing supporting cast too with jk simmons rosemary harris and the late cliff robertson this is the movie that set the bar for all comic book filmmaking and that made me into a die hard movie buff collecting merchandise sequels a reboot a sequel to that and the mcu versions followed very happy nostalgia critic loved it has its silly moments but balances everything out with its campy vibe the angles and imagery a well set up origin story and good pacing brought some much needed hope and optimism after a post cultural landscape with permeating themes of heroism as a lonely form of sacrifice this includes the heroes and the villains they all have good motivations and arcs proved that the genre didn t need to be overly dark or straight up silly and thankfully brought comic book movies back again paving the way for the marvel cinematic universe and so forth,0
oh lord jeremy you re one of those people he got bit by a spider and got spider powers why shouldnt he be able to shoot webs the web shooters to me never made sense i notice the web shooter fanboys always gotta go to that line at and its retarted i like how a movie about a guy who gets bit by a spider and gets powers isnt weird but where you draw the line is because he doesnt shoot webs out of his ass like a real spider,0
when i watch it it gives me chills and makes me excited what else is there to say,0
tobey is the,0
what an amazing movie,0
this is such a great movie i watched it as a kid and i m now rewatching the trilogy and it s somehow better than i remember,0
the st trailer starting with him running on the bridge just my family looking at me in the theater like ooooh shit he s gonna lose it then seeing it in theaters honestly brings a tear granted organic webs i wasn t for but i got past it the scene that made the movie was ben s death followed by the chase and then later his uncle s words echoing as he looks at what his suit would be this movie was my childhood glad my family was with me for it too it added to it as a kid this movie was everything i needed a st spider man movie to be nuff said,0
spiderman from the original trilogy is pretty enjoyable overall i honestly thought it d be unwatchable but it really is not,1
i dont think this necessarily indicates that jjj actually cares about people or spiderman he is protecting his most valueable money maker unless the director or writing staff confirmed this,0
they definitely need to do teaser trailers like they did them back then,0
i too man for me spiderman is the biggest disappointment ever,1
still my fave spiderman even though i enjoyed the heck of no way home i can objectively say andrew is the best i can objectively say tom is the best version blending all the styles mcu andrew tobey but for me tobey still is my fave and my best spiderman peter parker,1
great review on this classic film i love this film growing up as a child and i m glad i did with my dad and brother it s an amazing introduction to spider man to the mass audience and while cheesy at parts especially the dialogue some parts really hit me hard as an adult the scene that got to me is ben s death as peter made a lethal mistake really haunted him the scene with aunt may waiting for peter and her husband to return but sees only peter coming in with tears as he says the tragic news really got to me william dafoe and especially j k simmons killed it as green goblin and jameson you just can t unsee them with those roles,0
here after no way home,0
gotta go watch the trilogy now,1
i saw the movie in theaters but i m too young so i don t remember much however i do remember my yo sister getting spooked when the spider bit peter and i got scared when norman blacked out and that jump scare appeared the only time i can say my hype matched yours jeremy was in when i saw a commercial for a tit bit of spider man i remember doc ock from the ps game so seeing him on my cinder block television set was insane i also had the same feeling when i saw the tv spot game too because when you think about it it was the first open world super hero game i also remember one of my friends seeing superman returns and talking about the trailer for the third movie i got all sad when he said that spider man turned bad riding the glider robbing a bank good times,0
that was my second super hero movie i watched after xmen huge nostalgia,0
i might be or yr old in india when i was crying to my dad in a store to buy me the vcd of the spiderman movie even tho i don t know what that is but i liked the cover and i wanted it my dad didn t earn much at that time so he hesitated to invest in a pricey foreign film but he melted for me best experience of my life totally worth the tears i shed,0
jeremy please review in bruge,0
i think something that gets overlooked about this movie these days is that it was also a great ode to nyc really helped the people of the city because it came out a short time after had a lot of messages of hope unity for nyc,1
omg it s fucking spiderman damn i wish i had that moment as an excited year old spiderman fan boy i found out about the trailer through my cousin who lived across from me running to my house and saying dude a real spiderman movie is coming out i saw the trailer my reaction i m now and that feeling i had as an excited year old kid came back when andrew garfield and tobey maguire appeared onscreen in no way home,0
tobey is the best spidey to date,0
the best spider man better than ironman jr s movies i wish they d return to the raimi verse again,0
i really like the organtic webs the resources required for web shooters are beyond what peter parker has,0
u need to sit down and watch and go into it without preconceived notions watch it coming off of spider man and watch it in its context knowing the studio did meddle w raimi s vision watch it knowing it won t live up to spider man but that it is a good movie in its own right and on its own,0
jeremy i ll do spider man it s a process it ll happen one year later lmao,1
you are so right about the trailer thing,0
and here you guys could see the seven stages of grief,0
i hope tobey maguire knows just how big of a role he played not only in spider man but in the comic book community as a whole it s him and sam raimi who are to thank for essentially the birth of the mcu and the inspiration to filmmakers everywhere who have made excellent comic book movies an entire generation of fans actors and filmmakers alike are standing on their shoulders and if i have an inspiration it would have to be sam raimi for reinforcing the message that was in the comics from the beginning and exists with the character even today that anyone can be spider man and that it s about doing the right thing that s why i consider the raimi trilogy the best series of comic book movies of all time and raimi himself as one of the best filmmakers of all time,1
dude killed me with that snort after he mentioned venom watched it twice and laughed just as hard both times,0
it was jurassic park,0
he finally reviewed spider man,1
no he not getting the suit as fast as possible is okey because it is origin story and the first spiderman movie in new age so it was slower start the problem is when they made reboot of spiderman and yet again watching the same pace of the story is boring though for new people is maybe ok for rest of us who watched sam raimi spiderman is obsolete,0
cool man i didn t know you were a projectionist i was too i used to work the burbank between about my miss build up and tear down getting that call over the radio that something came in easily my favorite thing was right after we installed the digital imax i believe it was the first in a theater well when we first installed it we were just running a bunch of old movies through it but one magical day in christopher nolan came to burbank to see how he liked the look of digital imax for his imax tdk scenes so here i am watching the bank heist through the port with nolan sitting by himself in the middle of the theater never met him cool experience tho i also tailwrapped iron man on opening night during an interlock between two theaters lol neither theater got to see the nick fury tease that day,0
the heck was jeremy gonna say at,0
the original spider man score might be my favorite theme song of all time it s close between that and the lord of the rings,1
i also like drinking it s a sport which is best done alone in a fine robe,0
s m one year later,0
this is one of those movies with iconic moments imitated all over climbing up the wall trying to first shoot the web the rain kiss its a classic comic book movies don t have this kind of character or depth anymore its all about franchise building,0
to be honest he did create his suits so therr is that lol,0
i just watched the minute no ay home trailer as an ad for this video and dint skip it enjoy the paycheck jeremy haha,0
one year later,1
i grew up with this spider man and i was actually upset when i find out about web shooters i think its much cooler that he actually shoots webs from his wrists its more spider like he doesnt have to rely on some mechanical piece of equipment that anyone could use i might add which makes it less special to me and for the most part he doesnt have to worry about it running out it just makes more sense to me,0
coming from the s animated tv show and loving it this movie really blew my mind,1
eric voss made a good point that jj doesn t hide peter s identity out of loyalty but out of and exclusivity he didn t want his source getting out and that s a nice way to have the best of both worlds,1
the projectionist story is kinda awesome i would love for you to be on the cinemasins podcast to talk about projector life with the cinemasins crew,0
oh so you read comments then read this love you man keep doing what you re doing,0
re watching this review on before spider man now way home comes out in the theater click like if you re seeing this video xd,1
,1
it was my first superhero movie no such modern day superhero movies will ever match the experience i had with this movie,0
its so funny hearing jeremy talk about movie media back in the day because its so true i only ever saw trailers in the movie theaters or on vhs dvd i remember for spiderman i had this magazine of promo photos and a few stills and i would look at those same pages over and over and over again until we finally saw the movie lol then i probably still kept looking at those pages until the dvd,0
so jeremy still hasn t reviewed ramis spiderman of right be cool if he did before no way home,0
sooo about those other raimi movie reviews still happening or no i mean now would be a great time with nwh coming out in weeks,1
jj do already f r,0

just re watched this movie and my god william defoe was hilarious,0
where is the spiderman review lol,0
bonesaw is reeeady,0
this movie is the holy trinity of super movies along with superman and the dark knight imo,1
spider man pleasassaseeeese,1
just rewatched this trilogy for the first time in a long time and i have to say aside from spider man the films hold up incredibly well first one is still my favorite,0
in anticipation for no way home i m watching the raimi trilogy and i watched this yesterday i have never watched this trilogy before and i m kinda glad it has such a whimsical charm to it that i don t think i would ve appreciated as a kid overall i really enjoyed this one and how much of a cartoon green goblin was i m excited to see what all the hype is about with spider man,0
i m looking forward to your spider man and spider man reviews leading up to no way home this christmas,0
you talk about perfect casting and don t mention bone saw he s you for minutes minutes of playtime,1
i still think the goblin suit would look better if he had the purple rags and clothes over it,0
this was my all time favorite movies when i was younger i was spiderman for halloween years in a row and i would have the movie on repeat and would even play around with the special features on the dvd like the rouges gallery and hints for the ps game,0
spider man spider man spider man,0
how have u not done sam rami spider man bro come on its the best one literally done the rest but the best,0
do spiderman and,1
jeremy you gotta give us sam raimi s spider man review when you get a chance,0
and now jeremy time for you to review both cuts of spider man and make sure to watch the editors cut of spider man it s different and better and i already love spider man and think it s just as perfect as the first two so pretty please give it a watch,0
i love this movie i love toby maguire as spiderman i miss him as spiderman this is the first live action superhero movie i ve ever seen l was years old back in when i first watched this and i will always remember this movie i would go to my local pawn shop and buy this movie i am and a half years old now and i respect this movie ever more the cast captured the personality of the character their playing sam rami truly understood the characters,0
wait i thought i saw you made spider man and review what happened,0
norman osborn didint have dua personality before animated series and films before,0
yeah i shit my pants when that trailer came out i was in like th or th grads,0
jk simmons was the most perfect casting of any character in a superhero movie,0
still waiting on that spider man review,0
still no spiderman,0
jeremy spider man,0
when are you gonna do review for spider man and spider man and this is my favorite spiderman when it comes to tobey maguire playing spider man he my favorite spider man before andrew garfield and tom holland and i grew up with tobey maguire spider man and that why he my favorite when it comes to performance the spider man character,0
do all the whole sam raimi s spider man movies,0
spiderman,0
jeremy can you review and,0
when will you review the second film,0
this film and its incredible sequel are what truly defined the character peter was fleshed out so well sam raimi really understood his characters,0
the first marvel movie to showcase the flipping pages marvel logo tobey maguire said he had never read a spider man comic book but took the role because he liked the script at around mins the scene in which peter parker catches mary jane s lunch on the tray involved no cgi with the help of a sticky substance to keep the tray planted on his hand eventually after takes he performed the stunt exactly as seen,1
dude do your review of spiderman and,0
you forgot bone saw now that was my favorite part of the film awesome review bro been a fan for years,0
you gotta review the second one man the best one,0
i absolutely remember seeing the trailer when i went to see jurassic park in july of,0
tried to show this to my year old son and he thought it was cringe and didn t finish it the youth of today,1
there are screen tests out there with full on green goblin prosthetics making his eyebrows and mouth move it looks very interesting but i do think this spider man is grounded in some kind of reality the green goblin mask never bothered me because in the end it s psychological warfare a dude dresses up as a bat to scare bad guys and a dude dresses up as a goblin to scare good guys,0
spider man,0
i would like to see a review on spectacular spider man spoiler talk and all since its not too long of a series,0
that s not the only place he is,0
please review spider man and,0
tobey mcguire will always be spiderman period,0
tobey mcguire will always be spiderman period,0
one of my favorite movies great review,0
to me sam rami s spider man is a classic similar to richard dinner s superman may not perfect but timeless,1
my spider man forever,0
they barely showed the trailer because of,0
and thus it was the beginning for the most powerful bully to ever exist in any universe,0
j jonah jameson is a nice person i mean inside his heart,0
imagine if they had of used the original mask for the green goblin and don t forget that this movie upped on screen pg violence to the next level especially the grenade exploding in spider man s face,0
oh im gonna go review superhero movies years late nah im just messin around good review jeremy,0
spiderman now,0
where s the spider man review,0
i still think spider man is one of the best superhero films of all time i was never nostalgic for it but decided to watch it about months ago and was really blown away,1
we never got the other two reviews,0
this is jeremy s best review fight me,1
do spider man,0
that spoiler save was clean,0
but then aquaman beat spiderman in the opening weekend,0
this movie was the first movie i remember watching in theaters and it will always be iconic and a masterpiece,0
i watched this movie twice in one day when it first hit theaters when i was a kid,0
omg he s talking about eddie brock they re bringing in venom this is gonna be amazing bruh i could visualise the disappointment on jeremy s face in,1
in general spider man films pretty much peaked at spider man the following films were just convoluted cash grabs that doesn t even resemble the original source material,1
spider man awesometacular spider man awesometacular spider man good time with alcohol required the amazing spider man good time with alcohol required the amazing spider man you ll forget it in t minus spider man homecoming good time alcohol required spider man into the spiderverse worth buying on blu ray spider man far from home you ll forget it in t minus,1
i think it s time you review the rest of the spider man movies because it s safe to say that tobey maguire and andrew garfield are coming back for tom holland s rd spider man movie now that alfred molina and jamie foxx are returning as doc ock and electro get on it jeremy,0
i m such an idiot that when he claimed he was a projectionist i thought he was referencing to his personality back then cause i ve been hearing the word projecting themselves lot lately,1
i thought this trilogy was good but cheesey,0
i fucking love the og spider man films,1
random person why do you love spider man so much me shows them this movie,0
this will always be my favorite spider man movie,0
mannn had to come back to see what you been up to since the pandemic took out the theater industry for the time being and i m definitely not disappointed keep up the dope work bro,0
the movie that started the marvel universe,0
spider man,1
just saw it yesturday again proabably haven t seen it for about a decade and i didn t forget a single second of what goes down it gave me such nostalgia and is just as exciting as when i was a kid,1
really my only issues with this movie are that tony is a sad sap and the fact that he actually shoots webs,0
i remember those metal cans they kept movies in,0
i love this version of spider man because i watched it as a kid it holds a special place in my heart,0
i can t believe you didn t talk about uncle ben dude like how could you,0
spiderman raimi trilogy always felt corny to me but it doesnt feel cringey but when daredevil ghost rider and catwoman do corny moments its not charming,1
am i the only one who liked the green goblin design,0
i remember that trailer on an episode of entertainment tonight my grandma was watching and my god i look up at the right time to catch that same teaser trailer didn t think it was a spider man trailer till that chopper in the webbing and i lost my shit mind you i was at that time in sounded like i was years old again great times,1
where do all these guys come from,0
there s actually a video on youtube of them doing the green goblin mask test the big orange eyes and the mouth moves too,0
i love his wolverine style hair,0
really appreciate what this guy says he motivated me to,1
shave the beard i miss your face,0
review spider man please,0
please review only god forgives with ryan gosling directed by nicolas winding refn,0
this was actually the first movie i ever saw in theaters and seeing it is one of my earliest memories it blew my year old mind and remains my all time favorite movie,0
that s crazy they had the twin towers in the first trailer,0
this film is marvelous tobey will be back along with andrew and we will have the three spider men,0
ikr the danny elfman score is irreplaceable such epic iconic theme,1
i saw it in theaters once with my aunt sisters and cousins and then a second time with my dad walked out saw kids doing spiderman poses they were so cringe but this movie is very fun like scream,0
just rewatched this for the first time in about years still holds up,1
absolutely you are one fortunate awesome soul jeremy jahns sam raimi s spider man is both unique and undoubtedly successful willem dafoe toby maguire kirsten dunst jk simmons all great casting choices as a huge fan of comic book movies sam raimi s trilogy needs more appreciation than it deserves say what you will about the third instalment but he did do his best to give us a sold three parted story toby maguire andrew garfield tom holland have all achieved great success due to her own original takes on the beloved hero all are brilliant and amazing toby maguire will remain my first spider man that s because of sam raimi,1
hey jeremy apart from topher grace and the annoying news lady at the end spider man is really not that bad easily a good time if you re drunk i hated it too i never watched it again since that faithful day until now it s better than most modern comic book movies,0
spider man,0
this film was fucking wild i think i ve never loved a film so much i remember watching it when it first came out i was about years old and i was blown away amazing trilogy and tobey will always be my spiderman,0
jist watched spiderman an hour ago i swear the nostalgia is fantastic the movie imo holds up to this day its amazing no spectacular its the ultimate spider man,0
you know i m something of a sam raimi spiderman fan myself grin,0
jeremy do spiderman already,0
every time jeremy sniffs,0
i actually liked harry osborn as the new goblin in the third movie i was a little kid when i saw spider man in theaters i didn t see the other two because i was too young it blew my mind as a kid obviously now i definitely see it s the weakest of the trilogy and venom was completely wasted but they took a pretty mediocre character like the sand man and really made an awesome and compelling villain and i thought the new goblin suit was pretty kick ass that glider was amazing and the way it was scream down when he attacked peter was awesome plus the score during that fight was absolutely amazing and the fight itself was pretty exciting,0
the daily bugle in that movie was awesome,0
plz,0
please do spider man,0
c mon let s not miss mentioning that final brutal fight that none of the other spidey movies have achieved how spidey s suit ended up all battle damaged with the eyes cracked and tears here and there that was awesome,0
is a spiderman review coming,0
the reason tobey maguire gets shit for his interpretation of spider man is because of this bizarre thing that goes on in the spider man fan community where every time a new spider man franchise is started and a new actor takes on the role everyone is immediately like this is it guys this is the true definitive version of spider man forget the guys who came before they suck this is the one that gets it right they did it when the andrew garfield spider man came out and they did it again when the tom holland spider man came out and i guarantee you when they make another reboot and bring in a new actor the fans will praise that one and talk shit about tom holland,0
remember the days where you actually had to go to the theater to see trailers,0
mary jane was really great in this film and it s a shame people just think of her as the love interest her character arc is well written,1
damn jeremy turning into adult simba over here,1
say ye like me suit,0
best spider man movie period,0
oh my gosh can we please get a review on the other spider man movies in this series,1
man i loved this movie it was a love letter to spidey and by extension ny was it perfect no but damn if it didn t hit all the right notes and left you feeling like holy sh t that was spider man,0
i ve rewatched and even way too many times now and i ought to come back to those someday can t get enough of sam raimi s vision not sure if a popular or unpopular opinion but i have yet to see a spider man solo film that beats the original trilogy i m serious i still love even with all the bullshit production interference going on in the background also recent spider man flick fight scenes don t even come close to the epic consequential nature of sam raimi s works,1
you sir need to narrate old movies like mystery science is know for,0
where s your review for spider man lol,1
wweeeeeeee ll meet agaaainn ssspiiiderrmaaan,0
j k simmons willem dafoe alfred molina thomas hayden church the best cast of villains and side characters of s superhero movies aside from sir ian mckellan and heath ledger of course,0
do spider man you will not regret it,0
is there a cut of the movie where the helicopter scene was put in,0
hey guys this movie is old soo of course its gonna look like that haha its an awesome movie regardless,0
years later i still hate tobey as spiderman,0
jeremy has replaced edgar wright,0
i really do like holland s and the mcu s take on the character there are a lot of aspects to him that i was desperately missing with maguire and garfield but there s just so much missing from holland and the mcu that they got perfect in the raimi films i don t know if it s because of the rumored amount of their own stuff they have to license from sony to produce the new films but a lot of it is missed especially tonally now there are rumors about maguire popping up in doctor strange and all i can think is oh god they re going to give tobey the same fate they gave him in spider verse aren t they just one of these universes i d like to him actually wind up with mary jane just permanently i at least felt like i had that after sm but now i m worried i don t oh well,0
spider man is not a bad movie don t me,0
spider man who knows maybe i ll love it i know you won t,0
hey should definitely do a review of honey i strunk the kids,0
spider man is still the best spider man movie it feels like a comic book come to life honestly the cgi still holds up and looks so good i wonder how sam did it,0
will you review shawshank i wanna hear your thoughts,0
wait jeremy was working in shit i thought he was my age dude gotta be in like his late s damn,0
arguably better than the second but this one is definitely better than homecoming,1
rami s spider man series will always be the best til further notice,1
waaiiit villain telling the hero the people he protects will one day turn on him when they dont need him anymore pitching the idea they could just fight forever thats what the joker said,0
holy hell he s never done it before,0
oh it s john wick,0
jk simmons as jj jameson should be on the top cast of any movie of all time,1
the games that came out along side the first movies perfect,0
his face when he brought up venom,0
since the dawn of jeremy jahns on youtube i ve been looking forward to this review,0
no spoilers this has been released for decades,0
sam raimi s spider man nothing like comic no webshooters green goblin is just a suit and mask spider man venom looks very disappointed i m glad spider man never happen,0
marshmello,0
do spider man two,0
raimi spider man is spider man no other attempt at spider man has assembled such a fantastic cast or a score that is as iconic as elfmans or just the vision of spider man that raimi had all other film spideys play catch up to this one from the moment this movie was released,0
tobey mcguire is spider man everyone else is standing on the shoulders of giants,0
i have always felt like danny elfman s score came about after danny played some fable because my god some of the stings and licks in the score they really put me in mind of fable,0
i think there is some nostalgia bias here i never liked toby as spiderman,0
this movie will always have a special place in my heart i was in th grade when this came out i was busy being entirely enthralled with harry potter but this was my first introduction to comic books and superheroes and i just fell in love toby mcguire will always be my spider man awesometacular for sure spider man still holds the spot as my favorite superhero because of this fantastic movie,0
i don t care that mary jane was often in distress kirsten brought so much vulnerability to her that she made me care about the character also her chemistry with tobey was perfect as they were dating during shooting,1
i really do miss having to go to movie theaters to see new movie trailers,0
in spite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you unless you re robin williams danny devito or tim curry they are and have always been pretty beloved by all,0
looking forward to the schadenfreud of watching jeremy review,0
hey jeremy you didn t preference this review with spoiler alert lol,1
wow it was that long ago whew time flies,1
i still get a little misty at that one cheesy ny post moment at the end cheesy as hell but it just hits something,0
i can t stand the crybaby spiderman raimi movies the is no fun in those movies,0
spiderman gets a lotta hate cuz studios had to get involved in raimi s work i believe if they didn t interfere spiderman would ve been a great movie and we would ve had the perfect trilogy,0
i was less than six months old when this came out and it never particularly grabbed me because of that even then though the norman goblin stuff was really surreal and weird and i hate loved it,0
i really enjoy these movies but i feel even though they re good the only reason people defend it as hard as they do is cause of nostalgia,0
i m so high i can hear heaven,0
the only thing that was missing from j jonah jameson was a hitler stash,0
spiderman though it was a disappoint was not nearly as much of a corn dog to the soul as game of thrones with that context now spiderman it s alright xd,0
i m really excited for you to talk about the amazing spiderman now hahaha,0
look at jeremy face it s shows how he loves this movie,1
so now you gotta do spider man,0
aunt may sat down like it was a incest scene lol,0
great video hits it right on the head,0
looking like a white version of the late comedian dick gregory hah,0
ill never forget watching this spiderman with my brother in the theatre in being yrs old damn great times,0
spot on jeremy,0
great review dude spider man was definitely a magical movie when it came out,0
i guess i m the only lunatic that thought the cgi was so playstation looking cgi even back then i always hated the fx of these movies and then the green goblin suit that was power ranger territory right there super cheesy now j k simmons was gold he was the best part of the movie for me the story wasn t bad and the acting at times a little cheesy but not bad,0
my spider man,0
i have an essay to write specifically a movie review about my favorite movie i thank you for helping me,0
and then there was spider man and all was great until spider man the turd,0
day of getting jeremy to review spider man,0
tobey maguire is spiderman idc what you say,0
the rami suit is in marvel spider man ps nostalgia,0
i know there are superhero movies before spiderman but in this movie really opened my eyes to what superhero movies could do in the future and here we are with multiple superhero movies coming out every year and shared universes and soon multiverses,0
when i was a kid i would say god bless tobey maguire bc i didn t want spiderman to die,0
william dafoe is the best in this movie should be casted as the joker asap,0
imo this is the only good spider man movie the rest suck just my opinion though,1
going for the donald sutherland look,0
i love this movie so much it is my childhood,0
i remember it was premiered in the philippines and it was my birthday my father brought me and my brother to the mall for the premier and there was a man dressed as spider man performing and it was really an enjoying moment for an year old,0
i just love how people love this movie so much even tough its so fucking bad these movies are ridiculous its a comedy and i only watch them when im stoned and i wanna watch something weird,0
when i was kid i used to go on the internet to read up on action movies that were coming out mostly this entailed star wars prequel news and rumors surrounding a th batman installment in continuation schumacher s films one of the things i saw though was a picture of the green goblin and when my older brother called me a loser when he also saw the picture considering that the costume looked like some cheap power rangers outfit i can t say i blame him but part of me was more or less just unconvinced whether it was a real movie or not back in those days being a kid and all i couldn t tell the difference between fake internet rumors concerning sequels and actual movie news later that same year when i saw the fellowship of the ring the first lord of the rings film there was a trailer before the film for spiderman it blew my mind but not so much because i was a huge spiderman fan the truth is i liked the s cartoon and enjoyed reruns of the older spiderman and his amazing friends show but what amazed me was that i could tell that it was going to be visually spectacular it blended what i thought only worked in animation with live action angles that i had only seen in the matrix i did everything to make sure i was able to see it the day it came out may rd i m not lying when i tell you that i didn t have to look up that date however when the movie did finally come out i was disappointed i was years old and i felt like it was a little kids movie in the way it embraced the cheesiness ultimately i kind of just decided it was good it didn t take long for me to look past the faults and enjoy the film anyway i ended up buying it on dvd and enjoying it for years to come but the general life lesson was to not get my hopes up over a movie in the end it wasn t so much the movie s fault but my own for expecting it to be something more than it could be i went on to read the spiderman comics and to appreciate the source material more fully as a result i think i appreciate it even more today,1
you re just years late on this youtube came in around or so a decade then lol,0
we love the raimi spider man and part is what happens with studio interference,0
dr fauci is literally trying to save americans from the coronavirus and people are sending him death threats green goblin was right people are fucking stupid,1
drinking the kool aid a little too much are we,0
the best thing about the third one is sandman it was all fault of sony that wanted venom in that movie,1
spiderman cops to much flak raimis trilogy is perfect,0
my favourite movie ever,0
i had the release date for spider man on my calendar as kid,0
in retrospect spider man wasn t great but it s far from being the worst spidey movie,0
i m still waiting for spider man,0
hey man i always wanted to ask you this what do you have against admiral adama and does number six wear a wig i m pretty sure that s a wig but like an expensive one thanks in advance please don t sell out the human race to the toasters,0
could you please review the original x men movies,0
hell yeah jameson has some solid titanium balls on this i dont think its because he cares about peter but the fact that he would go to hell and back to protect his sources and his craft a legit screw you maniac and not giving you shit moment,0
i was two months old in july so i have no clue how hyped this movie was,0
holy crap i just unsubscribed coz you are flailing all over my screen,0
mcu spidey is a joke compared to this homecoming and far from home are just tween movies spidey was better with sony than marvel there i said it raimi movies spider verse spidey ps sure the tasm series was a miss step but everything else is gold,0
you are starting to look like the killer in teotfw and the inspector in sherlock,0
wtf happened to spiderman like what s the story on that how did it fail so miserably,0
you do you jeremy,0
i cant believe you didnt even mention the spiderman kiss scene with mary jane that scene was iconic and kirsten dunst pokies was iconic as well,0
get a haircut now,0
if spider man was made today it would be nearly impossible for sony to keep that teaser trailer a secret screencrush would probably have it leaked weeks before it came out in movie theaters,0
spider man,0
i remember when i was like years old and i couldn t watch the ending where spider man gets his ass beat it was too much for me lmao,0
watching the first spiderman when i was years old in was the beginning of seeing my comic book fantasies come to life on the screen,0
the intro,0
i saw this in theatres opening day and it was the most influential superhero movie i ve seen to this day remember without this one we wouldn t have had the mcu,1
if someday sony decides to do a spider verse movie with maguire garfield and holland i honestly think that movie will take the spot in highest grossing first weekend,0
the real hero in the movie is j jonah jameson when he protects peter parker,0
bring back tobey for spiderverse,0
a spiderman movie would change the course of history,0
cant wait for the spider man review,0
that trailer might be on my vhs copy of tim burton s planet of the apes gotta bust that gem out again,0
danny elfman made the movie with that score too,0
please do a review of butt boy,0
awesonetacular,0
hey do more throw back vids once the movie going experience has returned,0
jeremy jahn great video can you do spiderman review,0
okay jeremy definitely undersells this movie probably one of the most important movies of all time stepping stone to anything live action super hero related,0
this trilogy is goat worthy love it so much can t wait for tobeys spiderman in dr strange,0
emo dancing peter parker aside i really enjoyed spiderman also let us ignore the spidey senses dick joke,0
jeremy do some reviews of classic movies one flew over the cuckoo s nest dog day afternoon some more cultish lock stock and two romper stomper there are soooo many maybe a whole series of jack nicholson movies however i really appreciate you and your content,0
we can t forget about how awesome and dark and brutal the end fight is,0
damn jeremy are you me i was a projectionist around that time too you brought back memories,0
go back and watch raimi s darkman dude that s how columbia knew sam was perfect for spider man as awesome as it is i m still very curious how jim cameron s spider man would have been not to mention his planet of the apes but that s neither here nor there i remember the goose bumps i got when i saw that helicopter in the web between the towers man what a time to live in the music of the s may have a bowl of cream of poo soup but the movies were awesome,0
jeremy jahns wolverine s rebellious nephew,0
forgot to mention the locker room scene,0
why isn t this video monetized,0
damn i miss time before social media,1
this is my spiderman not iron boy,1
so u r like yo holy shit you look,0
i watched the trailer before this video and thought it was the wrong trailer till i saw the web,0
i still think some of the cgi still matches up with the current cgi i mean the avengers mcu cgi isn t great at all looks pretty similar,0
when he said that something fun happened in,1
i always argue with my friend about the raimi spider man he hates it and i love it he even said that garfield was the better spider man,1
jeremy are you going to a casting for wolverine,0
i d love to hear your thoughts on the original x men movie,0
your facial hair is exactly what is helping me thru this quarantine,0
what about the first michael bay transformers,0
spider man is my favorite out of the franchise that end scene when spidy cries and sandman just in hails pun unintended spidermans pain of loosing someone and then sandman just vanishes mid fight never to be seen that hit hard,0
i ve been waiting for a mars attacks review personally a very big shrug for eight years haha,0
jeremy please do the superman movies,0
this movie was huge when it came out it reminds me in when batman came out spider man was everywhere cereal halloween costumes soundtrack video games toys posters etc,0
excuse me tobey maguire as spiderman peter parker is perfection,1
poor guy he was never cool even after being bitten by the radioactive spider he s still flat af,0
looks like keanu reeves,0
what do you think about willem dafoe as joker fans are going crazy about it,0
this is my childhood,0
dude you re making me wanna grow my beard back awesome review,0
man dude jeremy is just so wholesome and great i love watching his videos because seeing his genuine personality is fucking golden it s like hanging out with him for a small portion of my day,0
wait so if jeremy was working in film in how old is he,0
this movie is still one of if not the best superhero origin movies ever love how dark and violent the end fight is as well the mj and peter scene at norman s funeral is also classic spider man stuff completely nailing the character,1
this movie is my childhood i saw twice when i was at the movies thanks mom,0
yeah i paused the video and directly went to view the trailer lol,0
thanks,0
sam raimi has gotten caught up in commerical success over the years and it kind of goes unnoticed what a great filmmaker he is evil dead trilogy darkman quick and the dead all brilliant,1
i felt the way you feel about this with lord of the rings having loved the books i saw a trailer and just lost it,0
when s the back to the future review,0
still wish we could get one final raimi spider man movie with tobey as an older spider man,1
i haven t watched your stuff in a while and holy shit dude loving the hair lmao,0
that bit where you mentioned j jonah jameson and the actor and what you were about to mention if you know you know,0
jeremy jahns the black,0
barnes and nobel don t you mean borders,0
this movie didn t age well at all and it has some atrocious acting in it,0
lol,0
i was working at a theater as well when the trailer and movie dropped those were the days fresh out of high school in,0
i remember getting the trilogy on dvd and they were awesome except for,0
i really wish they would have left the towers in it would have been an awesome tribute they missed an opportunity,0
yea i know,0
tobey spidey will always be our childhood hero period,0
jeremy pls shave,0
tobey was the perfect peter parker but didn t nail the spidey part not his fault as you say it s the writing garfield had the opposite problem of getting the spidey part right but not peter,0
they only made on sequel hahahahahahahahhaha,0
willem dafoe s green goblin josh brolin s thanos,0
never saw it looked too corny and we have a perfect spiderman now so i always thought it was pointless but maybe ill watch it,0
the final fight scene between spidey and green goblin is just freaking insane and it s up there with the train scene in spider man,0
the best spiderman trilogy we will ever get,1
this movie is why spiderman was my favorite super hero when i was a kid,0
you look kick ass keep tha look,0
spider man and are some of the greatest superhero movies ever,1
spider man is seriously underrated not in execution but the unique ideas they had in it peter regresses and becomes an asshole because he s never had to deal with success before he s like a starved kid in buffet he doesn t know how to control himself he spent so long being a loser that when he finally won at life it got to his head and it all goes downhill that s an idea i will always appreciate,1
haha i love this film whenever its on tnt and tbs i always have to watch this movie ages really well,0
spider man is not as bad as everyone remembers it had some bad stuff in it but i still consider it to be a great movie it s at the very least better than the mcu iron boy movies lol,1
super duper late review,0
green goblin was not so much the comic version as he was basically a mixture of two face and an evil iron man which ironically enough he actually did become in the comics as iron patriot still dafoe did an amazing job i just can t understand why they would hide his face when he had the perfect green goblin facial expressions and mannerisms without the suit they even explained how he gained powers without the suit probably to sale toys if i had to guess spider man is still the greatest spider man movie ever made,0
i m glad you noticed that jjj didn t tell goblin that peter brought the photos of spider man i rewatched the movie after an entire decade this year and was surprised to see that in the movie he may be an ass but when it comes down to it he does have more behind him,1
great review about it has actually grown on me big time i never hated it but i understood why people did now i watch it and the only thing i don t like about it is the douchy infected peter parker scene montage walking on the street and then at that night club well also to be honest it would have been better if they left one of the villains out of the movie probably sandman there just wasn t enough time to tell all three stories efficiently,0
i loved this movie when it came out one of the first pg movies i saw but i gotta say upon multiple rewatches the cheesy aspects of this movie makes it so hard for me to enjoy i want to love the hell out of it but i just can t still love spider man though my favorite spider man movie and i will say this about the raimi trilogy i love that new york city is essentially a character in its own right it s something the newer spider man movies have failed to do,0
when i read spidey comics i can only hear jk simmons voice when jameson is on the page perfect casting,0
jeremy do avatar the last airbender cartoon review,0
i loved this film and want tobey in the mcu,1
you look like season john wick from fortnite,0
i hope sam raimi does such a good job with dr strange including a cameo of maguire that he s given the green light on a spider man,1
fun fact this was the film that changed the bbfc rating system in the uk was changed to a in cinemas the previous rating meant no one under was allowed to see it a meant that kids could see it if accompanied by adults,0
very disturbing how good his hair is looking all long and flowing like that powerful daddy got even more powerful,0
i would love to hear what you think of sopranos honestly maybe you can review it sometime soon,0
i really hope if they ever do a live action into the spiderverse they bring toby back as middle aged spider man from the raimi universe cheesy dialogue and all,1
don t forget to check out and the editors cut of is amazing and the editors cut of just add a bit more of what you expected from sam raimi s spider man movies,1
before spider verse this had been my favorite movie ever i literally don t know how many times i have seen it both in spanish and english,0
please review arkansas tarantino like movie,0
jeremy slowly starting to look like jesus,1
my first spiderman live action film,0
the best spider man,0
jeremy watchmen please we ve been begging for years man,0
i was a projectionist too best job i ever had too bad the pay sucked and um digital i miss cigarette burns real projectionist know what i mean thanks jeremy,0
it s such a classic a very well done movie superb acting top notch cgi for the time perfect package it s quite something when i see the aunt may s suffering scene and i still shudder delivers us finish it from evil faints,0
jk simmons as j jonah is still the greatest cast in a marvel movie ever it s true,1
in my mind j jameson was a great guy because he liked peter for being who he really was not for the hero spiderman,1
interesting to see wolverine reviewing spider man,0
the second one is still the best superhero movie of all time,1
if tobey macguire s spiderman shows up in a cameo and meets tom holland spiderman in a multiverse crossover or whatever i hope holland has a line something like you ve got organic web shooters i don t know if i should be more jealous or grossed out,1
saw this movie in the theater when it came out and thought it was great i love that it s one of those movies you call rewatch over and over and still catch new things for instance it wasn t until this year when i noticed that when peter is first testing out web slinging he was on the rooftops and he hadn t even made his spiderman costume yet he was in street clothes anyway at one point he swings from one roof to another but he doesn t know how to stop so he smacks hard right into a wall that wall was painted with a big advertisement like a billboard the ad had a woman driving a car the spot on the wall where peter hit was the windshield of the car in the ad like a bug going splat into a windshield can t believe it took me this long to get that,1
holy shit is this wolverine or john wick,0
spider man took all the right things except william dafoe about the first one and amplified them my favorite spider man movie,0
gone in seconds review please,0
there is no bigger comicbook purist than me a sad thing specially today because if there were more like me at t would think twice to kill off dc comics and the collectable scene but the organic webshooters in the spider man movies were an amazing way to go i mean why not you can stick to walls and have spidersense organic webbing wouldn t be farfetched at all i like those even better then what ditko did on his comic character,1
please review and,0
jeremy jahns looks like lionel luthor,0
can i request to you midnight meat trian,0
yeah this review is fire i agree with all your points this was the true comic to film adaptation more than the x men movies the last time you will have true emotions and consequences for the hero s actions not like the mcu films in my opinion is lazily written stuffed with overused humor and male egos,0
bone saw is reeeaddyyy,0
am i the only one who thinks the pandemic hair style has done everyone good lol it s honestly made most people look way more awesome,0
have you seen the original green goblin mask it was awesome,0
he looks like moses from the bible,0
t was think what happened to jj and he popped up,0
it was in the jurassic park and i remember cause during our summer school they took us to watch it,1
saw a thumbnail where jeremy didn t have his apocalypse haircut and beard genuinely had to do a double take cause i didn t recognise the guy,0
digging the quarantine beard bro,0
excellent review glad to see you share your thoughts on this film i need to go and rewatch it now,1
now do the next,0
this doesn t pertain to the review but i would love to see jeremy cosplay as soul reaver s raziel someday i think he d be able to pull it off quite well,0
is it just me or dose jeremy s hair is looking like han solo in the battle front story with beard lol,1
had the same thing happen with my best friend we were in the theatre watching the trailers premovie and then there s this new trailer that is a nothing trailer a slow turning shape with nearly no sound or music and then slowly the theme starts getting louder tootum too tootum and then it ends on a giant t that moment with that theme sound was awesome sadly the movie was crap,0
i liked this movie better than spider man,0
it tried to be spider man no it was spider man,1
please review phenomenon jeremy i should not that this is truly appreciated though,0
the kissing scene instantly became iconic and it was never in the comics that s how much of an impact the movie had we would not have the superhero movies we have no without this film,1
an ode to happiness,0
jeremy please fix that hair you re scaring me,0
this shit rocks great movie,1
seeing the costume test before the pilot suit is the true goblin we should ve gotten,0
my favourite spiderman movie,0
kinda bummed he didn t talk spoilers,0
loved the video would really like to see the original mummy review so baddddd,0
the fact that i tell everyone who asks that i think the spiderman trilogy and yes i love possibly even more is the best movie series in the world for story direction characters emotion suspense music and development it makes it all the better hearing how these pro reviewers at least can agree on its achievement at being one of the best superhero movies of all time and that s enough for me,1
my spidey sense warned me that jeremy was going to punch me at the end,0
jeremy should be johnwick for halloween,0
death stranding review please,0
i am really missing the old energetic jermy where the videos used to be straight up funny with a lot of energy all the videos you have made this year felt like a battery down jermy with most of part simply boring what happen to jermy i think you need a timeout a refresher big fan from india,0
i am really missing the old energetic jermy where the videos used to be straight up funny with a lot of energy all the videos you have made this year felt like a battery down jermy with most of part simply boring what happen to jermy i think you need a timeout a refresher big fan from india,0
worth it right hell ya brother,0
dude keep the videos coming i watch almost every episode you and stun man,0
tom holland is fine it s just his spider man that s the problem he s written like garbage the romance is written like some pre k garbage it s not even awkward cute its just awkward both homecoming and far from home were written for kids meanwhile sam raimi s spiderman is written for humanity everybody can enjoy and is just okay but we know it wasn t raimi s fault it was the studio s fault,0
jeremy paul rudd jahns,1
can t blame tobey or sam raimi for how the rd movie ended up it is purely the fault of avi arad he s a big hollywood exec obsessed with venom the rd movie was just supposed to be about peter harry and sandman but avi arad forced venom into the movie last minute and they had to redo a lot of the movie and script there s a lot of backstory around the rd movie thats just fucked up and disappointing,0
day of asking jeremy to make spoiler review for sam raimi s spiderman,0
jk simmons jjj was so perfect man,0
please do who framed roger rabbit,0
great nostalgia watching this one you brought back all the points that made this a classic,0
having to watch spidey again you have my sympathy the first one is solid the sequel is sublime but sweet jesus that third installment is painful to sit through,0
leonardo dicaprio turned down the role saying he didn t felt that he was ready to put on the suit yet and chris klein from american pie was considred wes bentley american beauty was considered as well for peter parker,0
about min in i was starting to get concerned that he wasn t going to bring up j k simmons it s like he felt my concern,1
before sam raimi was hired to direct the film roland emmerich ang lee chris columbus jan de bont m night shyamalan tony scott were considered to direct,0
great movie,0
fun fact james franco audition for the role of peter parker but became harry instead freddie prinze jr wanted the role he was the first person he spoke to sam raimi but raimi was eyed on maguire from the start heath ledger turned down the role of peter parker in this film because it wasn t for him he would took someone else dream away,0
jeremy gives joel vibes,0
love this movie,0
i don t think younger generations appreciate just how cool and unique this was when it came out because the superhero genre today embodies modern mainstream cinema,0
tobay is the greatest spidey ever,1
i ll cry if i ever hear that danny elfman score in another spider man movie so beautiful,1
i think this movie is gonna be big,0
jeremy i think i speak for everyone when i say keep that beard and hair,0
you know i really wish jeremy kept doing the journal entries in would have loved to see him spiral into where he is at now anyone else think that would be awesome,0
wondering if you re ever gonna review tax collector,0
he s literally movie joe santiago,0
hey jeremy any thoughts about justice league the snyder cut teasers and get ready for dcfandome on this,0
i can t believe this spider man slander,1
dude you gotta have a video about your thoughts on cuties trailer,0
the hair while majestic makes ya head look huge or like that it is a floating head added in post,1
have i seen it,0
personally i think they should have went the route of spiderman having to fight harry osborn in the third one then have miles morales or spiderwoman as the reboot in the fourth movie,0
hey jeremy pleas do a review on amadeus it a classic that i d love to hear your thoughts about cheers,1
anyone notice that fine withe hair at the end of the beard,0
jeremy please review some of the witcher games if you can with cyberpunk a few months away would love your take,0
i saw this in theaters twice when it came out in and still enjoy this film till this day speaking of the trailer when it hit i was geeking tf out myself in and speaking of venom insert sad face,0
review the forest gump must watch movie and why aren t your reviewed yet,0
jeremy giving me captain american vibes in avengers infinity war,0
yeah i remember those comercials and i remember i was so hype i didn t know if it was going to be a bad movie like punisher or dare devil and yes i know that spiderman came out first but it s and exmaple that i felt it was going to be that way,0
keanu caveman reviews holy crap jahns lol you d better be directing a play with that look,0
when spider man was spider man not spidey ironman uncle ben tony stark,1
yes now you can review the spider man film spider man,1
typical americans no new movies so rewatch old american movies why not put that time in some foreign movies only when they win oscar best movie americans are like kids dont like subs,0
you should make a review of the sopranos best series ever,0
i think the scene where goblin makes peter choose between the trolley and mary jane is brilliant he literally creates a trolley dilemma for peter and in a way he s able to answer the age old question with the immortal words of uncle ben with great power comes great responsibility,0
i guess i ll agree with people that sam raimi s spider man movies are iconic but in a bizarre cheesy silly way,0
i loved the green goblin suit i like how they made it a shiny green and purple so the top looks like the hat i thought that was so clever and cool,0
review umbrella academy,0
seeing spidey swing through new york at the end as a year old kid for the first time caused the most satisfying chills i d ever felt at that point,1
i am so high i can hear heaven but heaven heaven don t hear me,0
ok here we go what about a review of the mummy with brandon frasier,0
spider man was the best out of all sam rami spidey films it was just so well written,0
best spider man ever i fell in love w kirsten in the movie and i m still waiting to date her today,0
remember seeing this at midnight showing,0
a projector friend of mine got me the trailer reel awesome,0
bonesaw is ready,0
i m so unbelievably happy you gave spider man an awesometacular good for you jeremy,0
the only complaint i have about this movie is about the butler not telling harry about the truth of normans death i know it was done for harry to become goblin but come on,0
that trailer i thought i dreamed that or made it up in my mind because i remembered being blown away by it because of how amazing it was but then never saw it again but you just proved it was real and showed it i just about cried jermy jahns,1
aye if captain america wields thor s hammer does he become god bless america,1
great review jeremy i know you re going to review the trilogy but when you can please review the one and only ivan,0
hey jeremy could you review batman under the red hood,0
sands of time yeahh review that plss,0
still have one of the posters from the pre promos actually the one with the twin towers in his lens crazy to think how history changed film like that it s always intrigued me seeing how films and games were impacted fun fact spider man enter electro for ps was impacted as well during the final boss,0
don t forget the macho man ohhhh yeahhh,0
i loved spiderman and so much it was devastating when they ruined spiderman,0
this movie felt like a big moment when it came out it felt like the dawn of a new era for blockbusters and cinema in general i love this movie it feels weighty too like an actual solid piece of filmmaking my problem with the new spider man films is that they re way too lightweight and throwaway,1
we still need and deserve a proper spider man vs venon movie with venon origins shown,0
to this day i still believe that jk simmons is the voice from the s cartoons jj jameson no one can convince me otherwise,0
yeah that villain was awesome and really well made would enjoy seeing defoe back as green goblin in the mcu,1
all the yes,0
jeremy your beard is so long,0
i actually enjoyed project power it stutters in a few places but was still enjoyable,0
my man looks like john wick,0
the andrew garfield movies were the best at showing how smart peter parker actually is,1
review the legacy of kain games preferably defiance you re a popular guy pal with your influence square crystal dynamics might consider carrying on with the story,0
before you nit pick don t forget sam rami gave us xena warrior princess dude with arms sounds hot,0
it s crazy how changed everything not only was the original teaser trailer never shown again after that but the original teaser poster of spider man facing the twin towers you see them in the reflection of his eye also instantly got pulled they were both absolutely perfect to pump people up for what was coming,0
you ll get your rent when you fix this goddamn door,0
spider man review please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please,1
please review the lighthouse this is at least my th attempt to try to get him to review it,0
the final fight is so powerful in this movie i love tobey and i love this movie,0
why the hell do you look exactly like silvio from the sopranos at certain angles,0
looking more like big boss,0

mauler recommended i check you out,0
hi jeremy please do kill bill vol also just want to say that your reviews is the only thing that has kept me sane during lockdown,0
wow,0
i wished they made a,1
sam rami s spider man trilogy is what i consider quintessential spider man like you can show this to someone who has never heard of spider man and by the end get the character and his world it also is unique in how it embraces it s source material you can tell it was made with love by someone who knew the material me i love all three yes you read that right i like spider man is it perfect no it s definitely flawed but it still sticks the landing for the most part,1
enjoying jeremy reviewing older movies hoping top gun the fugitive and the princess bride are on the to do list,0
og spidey is the best,0
bruh ya intro is why ys my favorite film youtuber,0
wow i didnt know jesus was on youtube,0
how many people left his video to watch the trailer,0
you gotta review unhinged dude,0
bone saw is ready macho man,0
lets goo,0
this one is still the best spiderman movie you should do escape from new york l a,0
amazing movie and the best trilogy,0
i remember editing spiderman movie to have the commercial of the twin tower s into the last of the movie it was amazing i gave it to a friend and he made it into a vlc,0
oh my god they re gonna bring in venom that pause hits hard,1
i still remember the joy i felt coming out the theaters as a yr old i was jumping off the walls and trying to climb up them,0
buy on blu ray,0
tobey forever,0
disney will never be able to top this iconic film,1
the first superhero movie i ever watched ill always love it,0
a movie that i will never forget a true new classic always watch it when its in tv,0
wolverine,0
classic better than baby iron man mcu version,0
this and the second of the three films he did was the best spider man films,0
the intro song really got me off guard,0
if you re looking for movies to watch and review i saw a movie that you could watch if you re bored and need a movie to kill time if you have the shudder streaming service there s a found footage horror film called host it takes place during a covid quarantine a group of friends decide to contact a medium via skype or zoom and have an online seance for fun and it backfires on all of them in a creepy way it s only minutes long so it wouldn t take up too much of your time i thought it was enjoyable enough you ve seen a lot of the scares in this movie on other horror films so it s not necessarily original but i thought they pulled it off pretty good in this it s an okay time killer type film,0
i miss the daily bugle it s classic spiderman and it is easily adaptable in the st century,1
with it s popularity souring would you do a review on avatar the last airbender,1
great video by the way when are you going to get a haircut and shave lol,0
john wick does movie reviews,0
jeremy is becoming amish ppl,0
jeremy is starting to look like arthur morgan,0
everyday jeremy looks more and more like jesus,0
this is still my favourite movie of all time and nothing will ever change that the newer spider man movies just haven t been able to capture the spidey tone as perfectly as sam raimi did it all those years ago what makes this movie so special is that it isn t just a great comic book film it s just a great film with plenty of heartfelt moments and perfectly written characters homecoming came close to capturing the spidey magic of old and i really do love that movie but holy crap was far from home a disaster that movie gave me absolutely nothing to love except for that one mysterio fight scene that felt like it was pulled straight out of the comics other than that the movie had me cringing the entire time i knew it was bad when even the jk simmons reveal at the end of the movie wasn t enough to get me excited after the trainwreck i had just witnessed oh well the good news is that tom holland is a good spider man i really hope the screenwriters make some drastic improvements to finish off his trilogy,0
i feel like the cheese was necessary looking back now considering raimi was paying tribute to the s spider man comics and all its campiness not to mention the soap opera of the comics in spite of the superficial details like the web shooters and the intellect raimi nailed the tone and message of the comics pretty well,1
i was years old when came around and most of my childhood memories were pretty murky i only remember seeing the trailer when i was a kid but couldn t remember if i was that excited for it even though i m one of the biggest spidey fans living today it s kinda interesting how one of my favorite movies of all time just kinda came and went away in this short phase that s my childhood barely leaving a distinct imprint on my memory then spider man came along and my spider man fanatic status was definitely sealed in history,1
if you review spider man watch the director s cut it s better,0
can you do a spoiler review of this so we can hear all of your thoughts,0
what s more iconic jeremy s beard or sam raimi s spider man,1
finally,0
i was excited about matrix but knowing now that the creators are bullshitting us into thinking their intention was that it was all a transsexual story all along i m done with hollywood no one can convince me otherwise that matrix isnt a christ buddhist allegory it just is,0
that sniffle at venom had me fucking dead,0
jeremy has the quarantine look,0
wtf happen to jeremy,0
they don t make films like this anymore,1
spider man is better than most people give it credit for definitely the weakest of the but still a pretty enjoyable movie,1
lol i also hadn t attempted to sit down and watch from beginning to end in a long time saw it on demand on hbo or prime or somewhere like or days ago tried to do it and made it maybe minutes in and quit i wasn t even able to do it ironically just to make fun of it lol it s bad,0
spider man is x better than you ll enjoy it,0
me and my boy just finished the trilogy we cop a half of bud every wednesday and watch one of the films we started amazing spider man yesterday and it just lacks the charm of the raimi trilogy,1
dammit jeremy don t give in to those day blah comments it ll never end i live in the seattle area and i ll start a day one of trying to get jeremy to meet me for a beer if you make it so easy actually i d probably try and meet you at a barber shop my treat lol,1
the best spiderman,1
if they ever do a live action into the spider verse i would love for toby to come back as the spiderman that teaches miles or maybe the one that dies just as a cameo either way it would be fun,0
dude you should check out the test footage of the original green goblin it was so creepy to the point that they had to scrap it cause it scared too many people mainly kids,0
this is a perfect review it made me go through the memories and emotions and thoughts i had when i watched this movie for the first time thank you jeremy,1
can t wait to see your review of spiderman,0
i ve always said that about jameson in that scene where he protects peter as a kid i didn t realise it but i eventually saw that that scene defined what kind of person jameson is when the chips are down and because of that i really came to respect that character in these movies,0
you can t change my mind about this but sam raimi s spider man is the best live action spider man adaptation ever,1
review the scream franchise,0
you should review spotlight after you are finished with the spider man movies spotlight it s on the netflix and i strongly believe everybody should watch it specially catholics,0
jeremy s beard by the end of quarantine will make just as many hand gestures as him,1
all excellent points perfect review for this lifetime spidey fan,0
jeremy you ever think of doing a poidcast,0
in my top favorite films ever with conan the barbarian w arnold of course and gladiator not objectively the best but after all i said favorite not best love spidey in general always have always will love this f ing movie too,0
if you wanna watch another pretty mediocre super power movie on netflix after project power go watch the movie code,0
sucks never we got sam raimi s carnage,0
could you review agents of s h i e l d now that it s all rapped up kinda a lot to ask,0
you look like silvio from sopranos in the thumbnail i said my piece chrissy,0
i like tobby just because of spiderman three,0
i genuinely believe that we wouldn t have movies like the avengers if it wasn t for this movie,1
keep the beard bro it looks good on you seriously,0
this spider man was the best not only because of the actors but the story the villains the setting is just better it feels like it is in our days now avengers is the worst thing to happen to spider man and not only that but so much futuristic bullcrap that they added to the villains and even to spider man,0
review step brothers,0
goodfellas anytime soon plz,0
bonesaw is still my all time favorite,0
a meme was born,0
everytime this is movie is on i watch in fact i watch this movie over the tom holland s whiny bitchy spider man,0
the first time in my life i ever felt anything like hype was at the end of the second film where harry begins to break and hears the ghost of his father in his head smashes the mirror and discoveres all the hidden goblin tech i still get goosebumps from how good that scene was,1
look mom this is why i didn t get chicks in high school worth it right as a mom now i d say yes it s worth it because i don t want my son getting chicks in high school and being irresponsible with them many teen boys are not ready for relationships in highschool but they do it any way and end up getting stds or starting unplanned pregnancies if spiderman can teach you to be responsible and keep you from that fate then yes it s totally worth it,1
jeremy looks like hugh jackman in the x men lol,0
review menace society or paid in full for the hood,0
jeremy if you re reading this can i please get a of review death stranding edit yeah fuck that can you review x men united,0
jeremy will be pleasantly surprised with its sooo good,0
such a great film i remember seeing this in theatre the ending watching spiderman get the shit kicked out of him with no music just bone crunching punches crushed me as a kid but i wouldn t change that scene for anything it gave this movie an edge that no other superhero movie has surpassed in my opinion,0
i remember when i saw it in a theater i was mesmerized and was pumped to play the ps game and wanted so bad to see the sequel that was a very magical moment for me and my little brother at the time,1
you nailed this review jeremy it s gotta be awesometacular,0
in the video games you can play as the goblin with the glider once you beat the game,0
there was no social media but there sure was forums everyone who really cared about movies knew about spider man way before the trailer hit and we also knew exactly when the trailer dropped and of course we all saw the trailer online even before we saw it in the theater we were actually doing quite alright without facebook instagram and twitter as far as information was concerned,0
shit came out like years ago,0
jhon wick now reviews old movies damn,0
jeremy wick,0
you ll probably like spiderman better now than you did back then,0
i remember watched this on dvd back when i was kindergarten i watched the movie a thousand time never gets bored,0
spiderman ps brought back my love for spiderman as i grew up with sam raimi spidey,0
this is the movie that made me the obsessive spider man fan that i am today,1
i guess i must have been extra nerdy because i remember being a senior in high school in reading about phantom menace and watching the trailer online then reading about the x men movie and watching the trailer in college so while there wasn t social network there was definitely internet resources,0
you should review savageland,0
finally one of the greatest movies of all time,1
sniff yeah,0
lol i m drinking apple juice lol never gets old,1
why does gray hairs always start in the beard that s all i could look at was the few gray hairs trying to count them lol,0
hey haha don t know if you ll read this but hearing you talk about these movies reminded me of the spectacular spiderman show knowing that you were dissapointed with venom you might really like the series it s been put on par with btas so if you get the chance please consider watching it,0
jeremy you look good,0
got that logan hair cut,0
omg yes jeremy finally doing a sam raimi spider man review,0
bro do love craft country,0
spider man is even better watch it you won t regret it jeremy,0
the worst part about green goblins costume is that they did create the perfect mask they actually made the goblin the way he should look but they didn t use it for some reason and went with the power rangers suit that we got just google spiderman movie unused green goblin and you ll see what we almost got there are even videos of the mask in motion and it s super creepy and perfect,0
just rewatched my k trilogy of rami spiderman s and the first one is one of the best of all time,0
that power pill movie that just came out was trash,0
review the first episodes of agents of shield i really want to see your opinion on the show before the new disney shows come out the show just finished its and finale season and was a great show,0
please review contact,0
nice review bro,0
hey jeremy you should talk about the new cod trailer,0
shout out tobey maguire cuh the goat,0
tobey the goat doe,0
when did the uni bomber start doing movie reviews,0
it s just a disposable action flick to me funny how opinions can differ,0
please review microsoft flight simulator or fall guys,0
i remember watching it and thinking wow they really made a live action spider man movie and my mind being blown going on the weekends with different sets of friends to watch was fun,0
i disagree with lines delivery not being tobey s fault yeah they were cheesy but look at arnold he has thousands and of cheesy action lines but it was still entertaining when he delivered them tobey on the other side felt like he was embarrassed by them again love him or hate him but andrew garfield encompassed the wit of spider man to bad the films where not good with this i am not saying toby s spider man was bad far from it i just feel that specially on the spider man persona of the character both garfield and holland do a slightly better job at it tobey s peter parker is still unmatched though,0
this movie does not hold up like at all if this movie came out today it would be considered one of the worst comic movies of all time,1
you can see webshooters,0
actually they would come out of his belly button,0
i still have the vhs of this movie from when i was a kid this is the movie that got me into comics and superheroes,0
hero was a great song not by nickelback tho but the lead vocalist i was obsessed with the movie but the comics were times better seriously they are all amazing even in the s,0
best thing raimi spiderman movie it grab emotional attachment to the characters whether it is goblin mary jane peter parker etc they bring an emotional journey to it in spiderman we feel for him to loosing power and the scene athe restaurant he gets his power back it brings that emotions to us if we create artificial webshooters like comic may be that scene never have that impact,0
as cheesy as they are these movies got spider man i feel like garfield s movies got different elements of the character and holland s spider man is completely unrecognizable as the character to me,0
great idea for a vid review a movie thats years old and pretty much everyone has seen awesome,0
the trailer was on jurassic park in,0
do spider man,0
what s the beard man,0
honestly you should ve just said you wanted to abou j k simmons jjj because if someone hasn t seen it yet then they don t deserve to,0
i loved everything about this movie except toby,0
about time already spider man is already here,0
perfect respons,0
as a comic book fan this spider man movie was ok but tobey maguire was a boring spider man he was kind of depressing in both characters there was no transition between pete and spidey not a lot of wise cracking or confidence when he was the hero not to mention the dumb stuff he did in school would automatically tell classmates he was spider man shoot webbings at lunch tray really,1
lol i will say one thing you are getting hairy you turning into a wearewolf,0
still better than both mcu spiderman films,1
f that if you want to drink you drink period,0
just realized you look like andy samberg i got reminded of jake peralta in jail hahaha,0
spiderman is better than spiderman,1

i wonder if jeremy will ever do legacy of kain series before everything goes back to normal,0
this movie was great can t wait for the sequel,1
imo this is the best spidey ever regardless of what critics say theres just something about this movie thats hard to explain man its such a crazy vibe the emotional scenes the dialogue the uncle ben factor the awesome casting i even liked goblins suite who cares if the mouth didnt move,0
that movie was so good at the time that my th grade teacher brought his spider special edition comics from the s or s and had us read them learning the origins of the green goblins yeah spiderman has a special place in our hearts especially for that time,1
please do a review video on amazon prime s the expanse series,0

i used to think he looked like keanu reeves a few years back now holy crap it s actually keanu,0
tobey is the best spiderman,0
love and enjoy sam raimi s spider man to this day,0
you can t think of spiderman without toby maguire,0
back to formula,0
green goblin in sam rami s spiderman was incredible the way he shows two different ego was really impressive and it was terrifying to see his scary facial expression come to think of it it was sad that he only appeared in first movie whenever i see willem dafoe he always reminds me of green goblin his acting was really commendable,0
john wick cosplay dewit,0
please shave bro,0
literally watched chris stuckmann s review yesterday damn what a movie they got peter so right in this,1
dang jeremy is looking badass,0
can we see your movie collection,0
pesky reviewer,0
look mom this is why i didn t get chicks in high school worth it right yea sure was instant like,0
review movie called i see you,0
he s turning into wolverine,0
my favorite spider man film and i say that genuinely it felt like a film with scenes and characters and a plot and the way it was shot they don t make movies like that anymore,0
pete castilioni,0
i love s cheese,0
i own a physical reel of that spider man trailer with the twin towers that he talks about great review as always jeremy jahns,1
do i need to see a specialist i cry every time i watch these films was i just the right age was it just made that well the elfman score the cast the story i even like the goblin suit lol,1
please do batman under the red hood,0

do darkman,0
you should review perks of being a wallflower,0
well now you just look like an out of work alcoholic wearing clothes lol jk i wish i could do what you do,0
spiderman was good dancing was just as goofy as the raining song scene in spiderman the action was good etc wish there was a spiderman and spiderman is still better than what we got later,0
spider man best villain spider man best written villain spider man too many damn villains,1
jeremy plz review joker put on a happy face this documentary was made for you,0
please mr jeremy john s sir do a review of spider man from i consider it the best superhero movie ever made even to this day feel free to skip spider man i saw your reaction when you were talking about them bringing in eddie brock as venom and yeah such a missed opportunity there and i think the biggest problem with is they tried to do too much they brought in two villains besides harry going goblin jr and tried to bring in gwen stacy it was such a mess and how does one even try to make sense of all those plot threads if they left gwen out and just focused on harry as the new green goblin and half way thru added venom i think it could have been good maybe even as much as the first two,0
j jonah jamison actually cares about his employees that he didn t give up peter does he care or does he more so care that peter is really the only person to give him good pictures of spiderman,0
lets do a quick survey like for toby dislike for tom and comment for andrew who is everyone s fav spiderman,0
still crazy as a kid i loved spiderman so much but i never thought that this trilogy along with xmen would set the road that would be the mcu,0
you should do john wick cosplay,0
you should review the original halloween,0
pizza time,0
now do yakuza,0
alright i ll watch it again today th time now,0
indiana jones please,0
love it bring on spider man loved molina as doc oc,0
why am i watching review of a film i watched like a times on the night before exam,1
it was my jam,0
i remember when the first trailer came out on jurassic par iii and had no clue what it was til i saw the web and i m like no way is it then spider man showed up on screen i was totally excited for by that point i was in but funny think i was still when spider man came out cuz of my birthday is on the summer time my mom took on friday night in town but there was a cop there saying there s only tickets left for spider man a few seconds pass its all sold out i was so mad so the next day my mom took me to amc theater which its my first time even going there when the hulk trailer was on spider man i m like oh wow another marvel movie as we watched spider man the funny part was when spider man was on the ceiling and his blood drop off of him and hit the floor as norman heard it hit the floor my mom said which she literally realized she said it so loud she said oh he heard that the whole theater laughed so loud too cuz of what she said then later that day i saw it again with my older sister and her friend when it came out on dvd and vhs my mom rented it for me and walked it all weekend long great times,0
thank you so much for this jeremy spider man please,0
dude i don t think it s a spoiler now they even did fake youtube news promos with that part last year on the official channel,0
you really need to watch the editors cut of spider man it does the rd film a lot of justice and gives it a much more natural and coherent pacing than the original release,0
this is still my favorite comic book movie,0
yeah i was kinda worried about jeremy in that last video i m glad he said he was ok,0
i like the hair but maybe trim down the beard that might set minds at ease,0
toby mcgwire acts like he s on valium,0
awesome video can t wait for you to review spider man at some point in the future it s funny to me that sam rami confirmed doctor strange s existence in his spider man world buy having his brother ted rami suggest that as one of the names to call doc ock and now he s directing doctor strange in the multiverse of madness,0
father jahns misty,0
i remember that commercial i was so excited as a kid but super sad because we had no money to go see and now i have it digital and dvd blue ray anyway i want to watch it this was my childhood,0
review nicolas cage between world s,0
it s true if spider man was real he d be cancelled today,0
raimi spider man are always be awesometacular to me as for spider man i get that some fans hated it but i also glad that it s seems some people found anew appreciation toward that movie personally it s still a solid decent movie albeit not as strong as spider man basically just like how i perceive tdk trilogy too,0
love toby as peter parker and people complain about the third movie but i loved it all the same peter and harry working together in the final fight was the hypest shit,1
you look like willem dafoe ate adam driver or vice versa,0
when you rewatch spider man watch it with the mindset the sam was forced to include venom and that he did try to research the character he grew up with the classic s and s comics and kinda stopped afterwards he researched more modern stuff like ultimate for these films and i think he deserves credit for that spider man was not his movie it was the movie sony forced him to make because people like me were begging for venom to come in and that conflicted with his ideal spider man he even toyed with the idea of using characters like black cat lizard vulture and electro and you can see it in concept art also he wanted to do this cool montage at the start of spider man where spidey beats up guys like rhino shocker prowler and even mysterio bruce campbell we were so close to the perfect cameo obviously spider man isn t perfect but it s still entertaining to this day and i have more fun watching it now with these facts in mind,0
jk simmons is and will always be my all time favorite casting choice also jeremy reminds me of diago from umbrella academy s,0
i was about when this movie came out and it blew my mind away toby mcguigan for me has always been spider man and though before this i already had experienced x men and batman robin which at the time loved this was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life,0
fucking finally,0
one of the most overrated movies ever,0
awesome f ckin tacular indeed,1
spiderman are amazing spiderman superhero movies the goblins suit was pretty dope to me man i really appreciated how willum defo portrayed the green goblin i feel he d make an amazing joker as well someday if it s ever in the cards,0
this is the movie that i feel influenced me the most in life because it was the movie that got me into acting and spider man was and my favorite character,1
idk about y all but i remember spider man being overly talkative and throwing quips around while fighting and i don t get that from tobey,0
jeremy starting to look like rasputin,0
love your channel but your review of project power wasn t my favorite and frankly lazy and wrong that s cool i ll keep watching you have some residual cool points from me,0
are you still in quarantine,0
i love this movie i still watch this trilogy from time to time,1
i think he is the strongest of all i get the stark suit gives holland more power but still as a specie shooting web naturally and his muscle strength is just superior,0
these day i watch u n mister stuckmann for mine movie reviews,0
we are who we choose to be now choose,0
this movie was mediocre perfect casting with peter parker but darkman level action was nowhere to be seen in this all action scenes were borrowed from better movies batman superman x men we deserved better than that in my review still stands b for a spiderman movie d for an action movie there i said it,0
yo jeremy there s a sasquatch that jacked your channel,0
man kids dont understand how great this movie was especially,0
that s a cute video did your husband make it for you,0
that s a cute opinion did your husband give it to you,0
there s a video where it shows the goblins original suit but they changed it cause it looked too scary,0
surprised you didnt talk about that final fight with goblin it was brutal my favorite fight scene in any spiderman movie,0
he don t have web shooters because he s poor that what makes the organic webbing more realistic,0
i heard that tobey is about to return as spidey,0
i love this fuckin movie me and my brother used to quote it all the time,0
you gotta do mars attacks its essential,0
this movie will forever be the most wholesome superhero movie ever into the spiderverse is a close second,0
i saw this with all my friends at the time some still friends some i just don t see anymore you time,0
omg i completely forgot about that twin towers teaser,0
are you in the elevator in spiderman,0
the test mask for the green goblin was soooo much better,0
whatever happened to tobey mcguire anyway,0
review the whole trilogy next,0
do you think that they will put the old spiderman movies on disney,0
felt like a soap opera,0
this was my first movie i saw in theaters with my dad when i was i instantly fell in love with spiderman it was such a great movie then came out and just nailed it,0
i remember this trailer i haven t seen it in so long i was starting to think it was a dream i had,0
damn jahns you outdid yourself with this one,0
mr jahns it may not be in your wheelhouse but have you ever reviewed the short kung fury it is pure brilliance,0
wait spiderman was ma,0
i have no embarassment with admitting i carried around spider man on vhs everywhere i went as a kid,1
i still remember how i found peter experimenting with his super powers on building rooftops to be one of the coolest scenes my year old self had ever seen in a movie,0
i m almost certain that would be spoiler was in fact he also played jj jameson in spiderman for ps,0
watched aquarium last night since they are showing older films and when my wife saw william dafoe she turned to me and said green goblin,1
this dude is becoming more and more like john wick and wolverine at the same time,0
tobey is the perfect spiderman no one else came close to him especially in his performances in the first,0
love this trilogy including spider man,0
love the new look,0
review some david lynch films please,0
ive been commenting bout manhunter yea you should review that,0
can you review an american pickle please,0
ang lee hulk next,0
sam rami spiderman and are my childhood movies i can t thank him enough for that,0
this is proper review that nostalgia critique was shiting all over this movie he even went that far that he did not mention high most important points of this movie he was rambling about some things like goblin and aunt may scene suit parker encounter with robber some noticebla cgi comparing it to newer movies even though in new spiderman cgi is noticeable and that movie was y newer etc,0
i feel you bro,0
i loved jj jamison so much in this movie and i do remember how he didn t give up peter parker up,0
jeremy don t do it don t go back please don t put your eyes through such pain don t watch the third movie just let it go jeremy please let it go,0
the over the top cartoony schlock is glorious and what s missing in most super hero movies now,0
yo you should check out the original green goblin costume they wanted to use looks dope ag,0
and to top it off we got a weird al parody song out of this movie ode to a superhero a parody of billy joels piano man,0
when he says jk simmons no spoilers and you know what he s talking about best feeling ever,0
spider man does have one of the best scores along with batman and superman,0
sam raimi s spiderman was my first movie going experience i was years old watching that movie with my dad and just last year i saw far from home with my dad for the last time before he passed away but sam raimi s spiderman will always be my favorite,0
well he actually does display his smarts in my opinion just cause he doesn t make his own shooters doesn t mean he isn t a genius i mean when they first walk in the museum he literally knows everything about spiders before even becoming spider man lol,0
my boy jeremy is starting to look like rasputin,0
wasn t it more like the s spider man that film like the era had this awkward combination of self serious ideas mixed with some of the campy execution of the s like hey look at the metal trimmed spidey suit while tobey delivers some cringey quips and has some strange moments figuring out the organic web or woah check out the metal plated goblin suit while dafoe is hamming up the role i love everything about the movie but man it definitely came out in,0
thanks for putting the teaser trailer in the description made it a lot easier to find d and yay my fave spiderman series of them all,0
to me the third one is the best,0
excellent review out of nowhere jeremy this makes me want to watch it again,1
can you please do one for the last samurai,0
i wish i was born to see this movie in theaters,0
the lord of the rings had the very first teaser for spider man your welcome lol,0
did you do a review on bojack horseman if not i d like to see your take on it,0
we did it lets gooooooo,0
you knew how to lure us in,0
is better than you remember trust me,0
that eddie brock moment had me ah if only we knew,0
he looks like bargain brand keanu ilike,0
the movie was so well crafted i remember watching it for the first time and thinking the animated series came to life,0
can we have reviews of shaun of the dead and hot fuzz,0
the scene where peter chases down his uncle s killer is still one of my all time favorite comic book hero movie moments to this day it s so good,1
i got jeremy s hair but can only grow a few chin hairs sigh,0
the original spider man will always have a special place in my heart i saw this in the theater with my dad and my sister and literally from that moment on i dived head first into everything spider man related i could get my hands on i had the action figures bed sheets shirts backpacks even underwear my mom also hand painted a giant spider man on my wall after i had neck surgery no matter what they do to try and reboot the series tobey will forever be my spider man peter parker,0
now spider man,0
loved the first two raimi spider man movies i just binged your previous video reviews the twilight reviews were hilarious and so true hope you see the originals tv show and review it though it ll hopefully give you the vampire werewolf lore movie scene that s actually good,0
jeremy tax collector,0
this one movie made my year old self a complete and nonstop spider man fan until the day i die i have so much nostalgia for this movie and i absolutely love every bit about this movie every time i rewatch it i can t help but get goosebumps throughout my favorite scenes with great power comes great responsibility,0
yes very awesometacular thanks jeremy,0
spider man spider man spider man it makes that s show a lot funnier but in actual seriousness it s not as bad as people make it out to be it s still a mess though,0
hair cut,0
holy shit i never even considered that this movie was shot during the time of no wonder it was such a big deal there could not have been a better time to premier the hero of new york city on the big screen,0
this video feels like it really came from the heart and i enjoyed it so much,0
spiderman,0
i was a really little kid when the sam rami spider man movies came out and in my opinion no one will ever replace toby maguire as spidey,0
i remember the trailer it was at jurassic park we got so excited for spider man then my friend walked out of jp,0
you should watch avatar the last airbender now that it s on netflix,1
you really justified that rating i was when i saw it and it blew my mind,0
ey joel s alive,0
every directory wanted this project and only sam rammi said i don t want to make a spider man movie i want to make a peter parker movie boom,0
excellent love letter to the movie,0
spider man was a pretty damn good comic book movie even though some of the cgi has is dated slightly,0
tobey spiderman tom spiderteen,0
how did trailers become worse and worse over the years,0
you won t love three but i did as a kid also bruce campbell,0
if dafoe never plays the joker it will be a crime against humanity,0
when jj jameson is lying to goblin about who is taking pictures of spider man when he is holding him by his neck didn t give parkers name out of principle i loved that,0
spider man spider man spider man zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,0
let s face it this one and number are still the best live action spider man films what a time that was also when the full trailer for this dropped it felt like the whole world stopped,0
hope you do part three because i m the only one who loves the dance,0
i would honestly love to hear more stories about you as a projectionist,0
this is without a doubt my favourite film ever dafoe absolutely kills it as norman raimi completely gets the character the tension is amazing it does spider man so well a lot better than the holland films,1
ur a nerd but i m an anime nerd so i can t judge,0
this movie is best for business,0
spider man was the best of the trilogy,0
i think spiderman is an absolute mess its completely tonally inconsistent its wayy overstuffed and its cheesy as hell and they should have kept it to or villains it s an absolute mess and i love it,0
do the sequels,0
alright i m going to try it i m going to leave a request for boondock saints relentlessly until i get my way,1
ahh back when we got good spider man movies good times,0
jeremy s look is like a cross between keanu reeves and wolverines atm love it,0
that trailer was a casualty of they cut that entire beginning from it after september that year i remember seeing it in the theater though and thinking that was going to be better than x men damn that was nearly years ago,0
attempt for jeremy to review requiem for a dream,1
give this man his haircut,0
i remember sitting on the stairs because the theater was so packed,0
what if raimi brought back dafoe s goblin in doctor strange but reedeming his costume with the advantages of modern techology and techniques,0
bruh review the indiana jones movies,0
i attempted to rewatch the original trilogy not too long ago and came to the conclusion that i really don t like tobey as peter i remember when those movies came out as well i was a junior in high school i was hyped and i totally enjoyed the first two but man i don t know if its because i ve become more cynical as i get older but i cannot stand their peter parker they did villains fantastically save for venom but beyond that i m good with ever watching them again,0
this dude is a hobo now without a gun,0
jeremy review event horizon,0
jeremy looks like christopher nolan,0
wasn t that bad it has its flaws definitely but it s an okay conclusion harry s ending always makes me sad and some of the peter stuff aside from the dancing is really good i think people automatically look down on it for having cheesy scenes like that but the sandman stuff is amazing the only flaw is venom but the symbiote controlling peter and all that is so iconic and i wish people would give the movie more credit,0
i m glad he cleared the air on how he s doing because i was one of those people like is he okay lol,0
this was pretty much how i felt at the time too please do the book of life,0
this is the closest spiderman transition to the big screen,0
great review jeremy and i still remember seeing that pre teaser in the theaters and getting excited great times rocking the beard btw,0
i see young jesus doing movie review now,0
years ago jesus i feel old now,1
dark review,0
would it be far fetched to ask for an amadeus review since jeremy is reviewing classics,0
when he sits on the bed with aunt may and he tells her i really missed him today i cry everytime without failure so much heart it doesn t feel like a superhero action movie as much as a real kid getting hit with powers that changed his life for better or worse i feel like we don t get that feeling from superhero movies anymore my fav spider man movie my fav superhero movie,1
atleast spiderman is not a year old with year old aunt i ll watch this rather than the new ones anyday,0
i think this look is a very good look for you mr jeremy you have pretty nice hair actually,0
real question it s why j jonah jameson hate spiderman without reason,0
this aunt may was and always will be my favorite,0
you now look like a man family man,0
honestly raimi is a good watch obviously it s got its flaws but it s so fun to watch and laugh at if you re looking at it face value,0
this trilogy will always be in my heart and the time surrounding it,1
come to think of it never did an original x men movie review either,0
been waiting a long time to hear your views on this i loved it way back when it came out i considered it one of the best superhero movies ever made but watching it again just the other night it falls flat for me now feels very out dated and very cheesey these days just doesn t feel the same for me anymore,0
no spoilers ha we all know what youre talking about,0
spider man is the second best spider man film only behind spider verse and the mandalorian is a great show,0
i used to watch spiderman animation series before this movie came i was already a fan of spiderman but when this movie came it was like dream came true i loved all movies of this spiderman until nolan s dark knight movies came spiderman was my most favourite superhero now he is nd favourite superhero i liked sam raimi s spiderman more than andrew s and tom holland s spiderman bcoz his movies where simply more inspiring than other movies and those quotes in the end of movies where simply perfect,0
i love it,0
also there s now versions of both spider man and spider man spider man and spider man the editor s cut,0
to be fair venom in sm was almost perfect like the characterization is spot on people were just mad he got killed off and never said we,0
of my favorite quotes from the movie all came from the green goblin itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout down came the goblin and took the spider out and godspeed spiderman are all the lines that i need when i want to become a supervillain,0
i love this movie i had it on vhs and used to watch it aaaaaaaalllllll the times,0
jeremy is really in his bag for this review love it,1
this video is not a bad spider man movie hitopfilms,1
raimi s films showed both sides of peter s life his economic problems his relationship troubles and of course crime fighting none of the other movies nailed all these aspects as these movies raimi is a spider man fan so he understood the character s and made the best live action interpretation of spiderman so far,1
last time i saw it was after far from home in the theaters i got way more pumped with rami s spiderman and was pointing out all the great aspects of a spiderman story that make it a spiderman story other than spiderman is in it and after that i got a ps and played spiderman ps and got depressed that thats not what we got in mcu spiderman but in between rami s spiderverse and ps spiderman i realized huh do i like spiderman more than batman turns out i do p i used to say i like marvel over dc but my favorite super hero is batman can t say that anymore,0
i love when people acknowledge that a movie isn t perfect or a masterpiece but it s something that means a lot to them and that s why they rate it so high i was in my s when the raimi trilogy came out but the movies didn t impact me as it did others i am glad to see people talk fondly about them without lashing out at those who love other spidey reiterations there s spidey for everyone and that s what we should be celebrating,1
actually now everytime i go to the theaters it s fun or boring that i kind of already watched the trailers presenting or i know what they re about while listening people in the surroundings talking about it,0
if they could channel that independence raimi s had with tom holland i think that would be a near perfect spider man,1
is there any miracle that we can have spiderman by sam raimi,0
you gotta do spider man haha,0
spider man isn t that bad it s much more disappointing than it is genuinely bad as a movie i d put it into the x men apocalypse dawn of justice category of incredibly bloated underdeveloped superhero movies that are still enjoyable for what they are,0
wow i watched this days ago for the first time in years great timing man lol,0
first,0
this is my favorite spiderman movie as well as the second one raimi s spiderman still the best for me,0
damn he looks so cool with that beard and hair i see some john wick vibes loool keanu ftw,0
i like this movie a lot don t get me wrong but i think nostalgia plays a big factor on people overlooking some of its flaws,0
swear this guy reviews this movie everyday like i always fuckin see it,0
out of work alcoholic artist so an artist,0
hey jeremy can you review fantastic fours from the version,0
i like the beard and long hair,0
whyyyyyy aren t you doing pan s labyrinth,0
i think your praise for this film should only be reserved for the nd film,0
one of the best childhood movies ever,0
if you are gonna make a video on spiderman i highly recommend you check out the editor s cut it help make the film a little better with some added scenes they didn t show in the theatrical version,0
i was a projectionist in my time as well i loved that job,0
i love sam raimi s spider man the st one and maybe the second one they always be my favorite spider man movies but the new ones are just kind of meh and that one with andrew garfield jesus those where just plain bad sort of of like sam raimi s rd spider man that was just i just don t know what the hell that was he must have been smoking something when he made that,0
the original green goblin mask from studio adi was way better than the actual one in my opinion,0
how about a review of the lighthouse,0
spiderman yay time for sling blade,1
second one was my fave i refuse to acknowledge a third one,0
review walter mitty,0
years later raimi s spider man is still the best live action version of the character nobody since has been able to capture the heart spirit of those original comics peters just a typical teen model hollywood cliche now,0
that ben parker scene oh man ill tear up again,0
spider man will always be one of the best superhero movies of all time,0
i gotta say spider man has aged much better than the garfield movies i challenge you to rewatch it it isn t great but it isn t as terrible as we all remember,0
i m pretty sure jeremy stole kurt russell s haircut from guardians of the galaxy,0
i was in sixth grade i came back from school and my mom told me about a movie trailer she saw she said that it was a superhero movie and the guy was flying what was the movie s name i asked spiderman mom said wha me mom if he was flying he must be superman mom no it was spiderman later that day while watching television i saw that advert holy shit it was spiderman and mom just misinterpreted swinging as flying and boy i got excited this was the movie that i had to see i had never gone to a theater before and i bawled my eyes out rolled around the floor and did some other shit to make my parents take me to see the movie we couldn t afford it so we didn t go but the local cable operator in my area was a good guy he heard me cry one day and told me that the pirated one will be on television soon i waited eagerly and one day there it was my first english superhero movie i didn t understand one sentence but i didn t give a shit because of what i was seeing to this day i get misty when i hear the sound of that movie,1
your hair is glorious,0
attempt to get jeremy to review the movie congo,0
the awsometacular spider man written by jeremy jahns is a comic title i would read,1
man i had a good childhood i remember spider man and it was the movie to see,0
my favorite trilogy i don t care what you say about spider man it s a an average movie with some bad and great moments but the trilogy is just so good,1
now the hype is real for the review of spider man,0
funny intro,0
im something of a scientist myself,1
spider man is the best probably just as good as the dark knight,0
jeremy could you please please do a review for hit tv show the umbrella academy s new season please,0
i was in first grade when this movie came out,1
really you actually asked in the end have you seen it,0
he stinks and i don t like him jim norton,1
the james cameron treatment had shocker and sandman as the villains with shocker accidentally glassing sandman at the end oh and spidey was supposed to have a ahem date with mj on top of the gw bridge,0
jeremy please never shave that glorious beard,0
jeremey should start a podcast i would definitely watch,0
dude sweet beard man,0
jeremy you of all people should know this with great beard comes great responsibility,0
you guys think maybe in a future spiderman movie they ll introduce the multi verse and bring this spiderman back and gardfield s too in that case i suppose,0
should ve gone ahead with the spoiler those who care should ve watched all of the spidey movies by now,0
,0
i was years old when this movie came out obviously don t remember watching it in theaters but i do remember playing the vhs tape over and over again growing up,0
alright lets try this day of asking jeremy to review return of the obra dinn,0
people who dont like tobey aren t true spidey fans imo,1
for the record i actually love the new look and dont want jeremy to shave or get a hair cut he was a good looking guy before but now he is a slice of mayn,0
toby maguire and his organic webshooters ruin it for me,0
speaking of willem dafoe to live and die in la would be a good review to do i have not seen that flick in years and i wonder what you think about it,0
attempt number pleeease review the witcher,0
hey dude i d love to hear your rewatch thoughts on ang lee s hulk i honestly love it more than any other hulk film and i feel there is alot of stuff he was trying to get into rage trauma etc and great visuals it was definitely a vision,0
i used to watch this movie everyday after school,0
this will always be one of my favourite movies of all time this and spiderman,0
it didnt have any sjw diversity,0
i read comments no you don t jeremy no you don t,0
this is the first movie i ever remember watching i got it on vhs and played til it was broken forever changed my outlook on life very relatable,0
do spree the joe keery film please o please,0
literally rewatched spider man and the other day and was thinking jeremy should review them thank you very much,0
this was my introduction to the character so the more comic book accurate ones feel weird to me,0
you should do a review of that netflix show daybreak,0
i just remembered toby mcguire wtf happened to toby mcguire,1
is this a repost,0
don t go yet oopsie,0
the original prototype goblin mask was horrifyingly brilliant,0
hey jeremy review superman returns,0
i was years old when this came out and i still get nervous watching dafoe s green goblin and then i get freaked the f out,1
sam raimi introduced me to spidey as i instantly fell in love with spidey ever since i first won the first movie in a silent auction in high school,1
man the talk of being a projectionist takes me back i remember lugging those metal tins around splicing the movies together having brainwraps happen on the films listening to god awful fanta commercial x a day because they put a mini projector that had to play before the trailers back when they first introduced that it was the last commercial before it stopped so i usually had to wait for it to stop to play the movie,0
sam raimi s spider man movie is a good movie,0
dude you re a sexy looking man with all the hair brother,0
you look like the punisher from the first episode lol,0
i disagree,0
bro u look like john wick,0
a masterpiece,0
there is a fantastic article written by av club about spider man and the relevance to and effect on a post ny,0
please please review the second and third movies,0
either you have spiderman have organic web or you have tony stark do everything for you unless you re andrew garfield,0
that is crazy the first movie i put together as a projectionist was ironman when you did spider man did you have the locked cases so you were not able to screen the movie early,0
i was one of the people screaming when awesometacular came on screen to this day i still hear norman s voice when dafoe goes on a tirade so great they had him come back for the sequels,0
a cornerstone of my childhood a classic,0
if you get a haircut i m unsubbing trim the beard don t cut this look is fire,0
where s the rest of the harry potter reviews,0
the sad spiderman theme is ripped off from the th mahler simphony last movement,0
i now listened to my own heart doctor strange on the hands of sam raimi waiting to make another history hey jeremy u did well but why u didn t talked about uncle ben s dialogue which is my all time favourite with great power comes great responsibility,1
never understood the love for this movie for me it was just a cheesy chick flic masquerading as a superhero movie,0
react to the tax collector with shia in it,0
i can just hear the music by danny eflman playing,1
this and spiderman are better hero movies than most if not all the of the marvel studios movies so much of the disney marvel era has devolved their movies into being so much more about the super and so little about the hero,0
your videos are always fantastic man keep it up sad to see bathrobe jeremy is on hiatus hope he s doing well,0
i also appreciate raimi s horror touch in the movie,1
my favorite spider man movie,0
james cameron s spider man script came up with the organic web shooters,0
please review mile at some point,1
i always liked the green goblin s outfit in this movie i don t know why i just do also that eddie brock line they use in this movie is retconed by the third movie cuz he s a recent hire in that movie,0

the sequel is one of my most favourite comicbook movies ever,1
will you be reviewing the lighthouse,0
i ll take cheese and heart over the depressing movies of today any day,0
finish it finish it,0
the raimi spider man suit is perfection,1
this movie was literally what first inspired me to write i remember watching it for the first time and just loving it so so much i watched it two more times that week,0
this was my first super hero movie,1
sam raimi s spider man trilogy will always be my favorite comicbook movie trilogy i love the themes in the third movie how you are your worst enemy,0
i think this and the second movie are still better movies by lightyears compared to the later ones and the third would ve been just as epic if the damn studio hadn t meddled they were relatable and serious yet knew how to have fun with the whole thing so many great pieces working amazingly together memorable moments now they re just franchise formulae soulless i can t remember anything specific from the new movies don t get me wrong they have some things going for them,0
umbrella academy,0
no mention of that brutal final fight it holds up pretty well,0
do a review for sam raimi s darkman,0
i still laugh at when my brother and i saw spiderman and when it hit that moment where peter forgives sandman and the latter just simply vanishes with a smile i ruined the moment by putting on my best hook peter pan impersonation and went thank you for believing in meeeeeee ironically the dancing peter didn t bother me by comparison p,0
personally spiderman homecoming will always be my favorite spiderman movie but raimis spiderman will always have a special place in my heart,0
the og,0
jeremy looks like he would be a character in the classic movie the thing,0
jeremy is rocking that hairy john marston style,0
i watched mask of the phantasm last night after watching your review and now i might just have to do the same tonight for spiderman,0
review the bloody lighthouse for fuck sake,0
this is my favorite spider man movie it transports me back to that time instantly i have so many good feelings about this film,0
aquaman beat spider man in,0
maybe its because i was born in so i didn t start watching movies seriously until late naughties but i absolutely hate all s early s movies because i hate the cheesiness of them they re so popular with millennials and prior generations but i have never liked them does anyone else feel this way,0
please do the spiderman it s one of the films where the sequel is as good better than the original,0
you know barbers are open now jeremy,0
jeremy can you review dark series,0

kinda sad there was no reference of bonesaw seeing the macho man really got me excited as a kid,0
sam raimi s spiderman was the first ever superhero movie i d seen i still remember my craze about it i bought t shirts printed with spidey and i changed my school bag to a spiderman bag too i even wore a spiderman costume to school once i was crazy about spiderman during that time i was yrs old born in they called me the spider girl though i m scared of spiders now lol i still love the movies they re a fond memory for me i still have the dvd of spiderman,0
awesome video with great energy do you ever wish you could go back and experience movies without social media telling you what to think or toxic fanboys ruining everything sigh a simpler time,0
aht aht scotch robe bearded jeremy is top jeremy s of all time,0
this movie taught me one thing willem defoe is cheesy awesomeness rivalling nicolas cage i honestly love the trilogy all of it even the bad part of grew on me dancing peter is seriously hilarious even if it really didnt showcase the effect the sybiote had on him mentally,0
review the quick and the dead,0
i enjoy holland i tolerate garfield but maguire is my spiderman,1

tom holland spiderman i prefer the real spiderman sam raimi spiderman i said the real spiderman s spiderman show perfection edit rip andrew garfield spiderman,0
this version of spiderman for me is a better than all the tom holland versions,0
i can t wait for the spider man movie review,0
spider man has actually aged really well still the weak point but not as bad as you remember very charming,0
sam raimis spiderman had a better vision than the star wars sequels,1
spider man hit me really hard it s still one of the greatest superhero movies i ve ever watched it is right there with the dark knight man of steel and iron man,0
still hands down the best spider man film,0
those were the days,0
you re going for the next wolverine role aren t you i like it bro,0
he s what he s what please tell me,0
can we get a zodiac review please,1
sam raimi understand depth of comic book character he made the best comic book ever which was spider man,0
i hope tobey one day does a cameo in the new spider man movies like jk simons like in a spiderverse you know i will literally cry out my year old me,1
hell yes i m so glad you love the sam raimi trilogy it s soo fkng amazing i m excited for your next spidey reviews please sit down and appreciate spider man for what it is and what it could ve been if venom wasn t in to ruin it all sam tried they force venom onto him still spider man remains a great movie if you can look past that i can honestly it aged extremely well and it s a must better experience now than it was before i think we just weren t ready and had rightfully so our expectations elsewhere,1
if your going to watch spiderman i recommend the editors cut,0
classic,0
sam ramis spider man is proof that studio heads needs to stay out of the making of movies are classics and then the studio pushed in and made rami change his vision and if shows in,0
auditioning for the next next shitty movie this is dogsh t,0
achievement unlocked huge responsibility do a spiderman review without mentioning the words great responsibility once,1
god yes that score always gave me goosebumps,1
i m surprised at the love this trilogy still gets i ve always thought it was way too cheesy and toby was such a dork and not in a boy genius spiderman way the costume and dafoe are great though i guess i m the only one oh well to each their own,0
ah man toby is spider man i remember being about years old seeing the movie for the first time with my dad my uncle and my cousins after the movie there was a reenactment in the theater from pretty close looking doubles of the characters at that point i thought it was the characters themselves ah man and then i remember after the movie was over i whipped out the fake spiderwebbing foam spray my dad had got me and i was running around with my cousins recreating scenes in our heads from the movie while we were outside the theater hopping over rails stumbling out of bushes jumping down the steps ah man one of the best times of my life never had another experience like that one again man,0
the movie that started it all,0
nice to see jeremy looking hale again scared me man also my favourite line from spider man was peter saying you re out gobby out of your mind sick burn,0
this movie came out the day i was born,1
jeremy when you go to review spider man watch the editors cut first before you revisit the theatrical then give us you re thoughts would love to hear what you think of the few changes they made for the editors cut cheers,0
off topic but doesn t jeremy look like rick grimes when he bit that dudes that out no just me ok,0
when this movie s record setting box office numbers were released i did a little happy dance and screamed for joy finally movie studios were going to realize superhero movies could make them bank oh so much bank,0
as good as spider man was and even if it was a more technically proficient film i still have always enjoyed the first a little more but then i ve always been a sucker for origin stories i think what really does it the most for me though in this particular film is how we get to discover and be amazed right alongside peter as he s first realizing his potential also willem dafoe da foe the foe while i actually liked maguire a lot in those films after tom holland came along tom replaced toby as the best peter parker even if i still believe the first two spider man films as a whole are more enjoyable also i grew up as a comic book nerd and spider man and batman were my favorite solo characters although more spider man by a huge margin and x men for team characters all growing up i always wondered how long it would take before we got those translated to film in a good way if ever the burton movies were great for what he was able to do but they still seemed both simultaneously low key and over the top and not quite what i was wanting when the first two rami films hit they just floored me and i thought we have finally arrived in terms of translating a comic book character with the feel of a comic book character and without being ridiculous to film then nolan came along and made things more grounded and i thoroughly loved the first two of his batman films forward to avengers and what marvel has been able to do with the mcu and for the most part it s everything a kid like me would have wanted back then shitty hulk cgi aside it might have started with the first superman film but i think rami s spider man really set the ball rolling lastly keep the i haven t been able to go to the barber s since is bullshit look it s pretty suave,0
please review perfume the story a murderer,0
this movie started the tradition of me bringing my kid to a marvel movie for her birthday she was six she turned this year and it was the first time since there wasn t a movie to see it was going to be black widow,0
jeremy wick,0
oh my god it s fucking spider man valid reaction,0
the longer trailer for this movie was so bad it made the film look garbage the made it look cartoony and all style over substance when i was actually blown away same thing happened with s x men that trailer campaign was too,0
the monster trio of peter globin and jj was best you can get,0
correction sixties spider man tone sam raimi s spider verse feels a lot like a comic from the ditko era sixties,0
sam raimi s spider man was the best spiderman film followed by spider man into the spiderverse fight me tom holland is adorable but his spiderman is too iron manish and doesn t feel right for some reason atleast to me,1
nah willem defoe was born to play tom in the lighthouse also do the lighthouse dude,0
the mtv movie awards did a parody of this its hilarious,0
i m liking jeremy s new look,0
i love quarantine jahns because it s the only time we can actually hear him unscripted and having a blast reviewing what he loves also spiderman is o k spiderman is the equivalent of dark knight change my mind,1
jeremy s beard is giving me jason momoa vibes,0
with our uncle ben there is no spider man that s why the mcu has spider boi or little iron man jr,0
time to review blade and trinity,0
when are you going to review avatar the last airbender,0
well assamy considering the color of your beard and the length of your hair when is this gandalf cosplay event going to take place,0
jeremy for obi wan kenobi,0
oeehhh you read comments how about this rocking that beard jeremy,1
tobey maguire is the best spider man come at me,1
the like to dislike ratio is so good love this channel and love to see it thriving still after all these years,1
as soon as johnny said no spoilers i was like bruh everyone has seen the new spiderman,1
now we want spiderman and spiderman review too,0
jeremy be looking like john wickseau,0
take a bath ya hippie lolol,1
okay alright that alright with you i yes sir goodie,1
hey man how about making a playist will all the movies that you rate awesometacular,0
excellent review for a great film,0
we re told he s smart but we don t see him do anything with that intellect that s a mood,1
possibly your longest intro ever,1
spider man environment then school oscorp daily bugle spider man now avengers avengers avengers school edit,1
mcguire is the best spiderman till date and of course the movie too,1
the nickelback scene,0
i love how passionate he is about all of this he s describing like every scene,1
i enjoy these spiderman movies more than the avergers spiderman,0
i will never forget the day i went to see jurassic park in theaters with my dad i was about to turn and my favorite superhero just happened to be spider man i was in complete shock when i saw the helicopter in that web and actually seeing a live action spider man swinging in new york i will never forget the obsession of just wanting to watch it again i even thought it would be on the jurassic park dvd but it wasn t unfortunately lol but i eventually gave up because i got distracted by the actual movie i then stumbled upon the original trailer in my late teens on youtube and the feeling of nostolgia was so strong it made me feel happy sad and sick in a few different ways lol that was such an impact on my childhood but i thought i would share i need to go to bed i have to work in the morning,0
i cried with fear watching willem dafoe talking to himself that was scary lol,0
who else remembers a there was no social media time ah simpler time s nostalgia so hard,1
i was just a year old kid when i watched the first spider man film and the moment green goblin blows up aunt may s house and starts terrorizing her i was absolutely scared as shit up to the point for me to hide behind the front seats so huge props to sam raimi for using his horror film background and for making a kid almost crap his pants,0
sooooooooo you gonna do spider man now,0
he did not mention the song at the end with nickelback shame jeremy shame,1
hey jeremy are you gonna shave until the virus of unknown origin gets a vaccine,0
it wasn t sam s fault for spider man he wanted just harry as goblin but sony butted in and pushed him to do venom,0
jeremy should audition as wolverine for the mcu,0
spiderman please pleassseeeee,0
green goblin doesn t actually have any conflict with peter parker or spider man in the movie because spider man isn t trying to stop the green goblin he s just reacting to him green goblin accomplishes all of his goals and then completely unmotivated decides he hates spider man,0
i really dislike the toby maguire spiderman rendition for me tom holland is the best also andrew garfield was actually not bad either,1
sam raimi s trilogy is the best superhero movies of all time and no the third one is amazing as well just watch it,1
jeremy said he reads comments so i hope he has a good day,0
it was final fantasy animated movie that it was attached to in my area,0
if jeremy was a projectionist in that was a around years ago so jeremy must ve been in his late teens or very early twenties that would make him almost today he looks great,0
lol the no spoilers line if you haven t seen that film yet then you really don t care about spoilers,0
jeremy please review mighty morphin power rangers the movie film,0
corona does this to people it all but not normal,0
and he s riding around on that glider thing and he s throwing that weird pumpkin bomb yeah he s wearing that dumb power rangers mask but he s scarier without it on weird al ode to a superhero,1
every time jeremy mentions past as a projectionist i think of tyler derden,0
jeremy s developing that jesse pinkman look,1
wait people didn t see the humor in the last video,0
this movie is the reason why i m living,0
let s gooo finally also that story at the beginning was so freaking wholesome i am so freaking hyped for the spider man review,0
fox kids s animated spiderman series was like the sam raimi spiderman movies it was fun funny and had very serious undertones as well,0
when those people on the bridge help spiderman by throwing stuff at the green goblin makes me fuckin cry every time,0
spiderman are the best spiderman movies period,0
thank you for this review jeremy the story you gave working in a movie theater was,0
jeremy is preparing for the last of us in america,1
fun fact willem dafoe actually doing of his stunts in this movie and even he s already terrifying without wearing his green goblin mask he is an underrated actor tho people should praise him more for his powerful actings,1
jk simmons is to jj what kevin conroy is to batman change my mind,0
the sam raimi spiderman trilogy are the best spiderman movies,0
jeremy could you please review hbo s true detective,0
no mention of the most quoted quote ever with great power comes great responsibility poor uncle ben,1
the real question is which is better spiderman or spiderman let s not talk about spiderman,0
jeremy would you review possession,0
the rami trilogy is perfection even they re just so much f king fun,1
back when trailers were trailers like the fact that they never showed the suit was awesome i was when it came out actually the first movie i ever saw in the theater was spiderman such a classic,0
was or when this came out and my dad took me to the theatre to watch it those were good times,0
jeremy has the high ground with that look,0
its sonys fault for spiderman not sam,0
next up spider pig review,0
honestly with insomniac making harry have the symbiote and i think their was a spiderman tv episode where he had it i wish harry had the symbiote after their fight in harrys home peter gets rid of it and it finds its way back to harry now you rid the character of eddie brock and free up so much screen time and you can give harry even more of a arch hell how peter tries to turn brock he turns harry and harry takes control of venom like how dr octavius takes back control and they go after sandman or harry fails to take control of venom but we can see harry ahs changed and forgives peter but venom is in control and they have to destory venom and harry dies in the process or fuck it harry gets out of venom and at the end them three have to fight the rela big ass venom we saw when eddie was pulled from venom,0
spiderman is a really good movie when you put the negative thouhts out,0
it s funny i just showed my son this movie for first time today,0
love the trilogy just bought the blue ray collection today problem is the digital download codes expired last year what do i do,0
i wonder how jeremy would react to how jeremy looks,0
still the best comic adaptations to date yeah don t like stuff with web shooters and green goblins outfit isn t the best but it shows you that you won t care about nitpicks when you have a good cast it shows you how having a good atmosphere and drama that connects you to that characters is important mary jane gets saved but she was like that in comics i hate that today everything has to be politically correct so in the process it loses its soul,0
reviewing the holy trilogy yesss,0
hey you might end up loving spider man when u rewatch it again i just watched attack of the clones for the first time in years and i ended up really liking it of course it s still not as good as the other the sequels don t exist but it was still good,1
people call the raimi spider man movies campy but theres more real emotion tension and even realism than the mcu on top of having better jokes,1
jeremy plz watch oldboy the korean one and if you have plz review it,0
without this movie and the first xmen we wouldn t have the great comicbook films we get today,0
no super hero movie maybe with the exception of s trainfight has been able to top that final battle between spider man and the green goblin it was so brutal and intense and violent watches later and i m still on the edge of my seat every time,1
well said sir,0
new york must be nailed and must be a character in a spiderman film raimi made new york a character and did it very well webb did it at the end of the first amazing spdierman film the mcu has failed to do so but it feels they are trying to take him away from new york so that when hes a avenger people won t bring it up which i guess ima bring it up marvel really needed spiderman to have his own universe within the mcu and not focus to much on the mcu out of all of marvel spiderman has the best collection of characters and villains and they have yet to take advantage of that,0
hell yeah another vid from jeremy,0
the best spider man film imo,0
in the immortal words of weird al yankovic speaking of the green goblin yes he s wearin that dumb power rangers mask but he s scarier without it on,0
people neglect mary jane of the subtle character arc she goes through ya know she is a damsel but it s something,0
the chances of you seeing this are infinitesimal but matpat did a video going over the whole jjj scene where claims he doesn t know who takes the photos of spider man the reason i mention it as a recommendation is because it sets a new perspective for that scene given the theory behind his supposed reasoning its interesting enough to pique your interest and just give a new outlook to consider when you rewatch that scene,0
he s protecting his sources he s a reporter did lois lane teach you nothing,0
lets go,0
i love all three movies that shit is just my childhood,1
ironically the only other person i could see playing j jonah jameson is michael keaton,0
jeremy origin story,0
i m sorry but jk simmons made jjj a joke in this franchise he really did great performance maybe but that s not really jonah,0
sam raimi s spider man is the spider man of our generation d,1
lol guess i wasnt the only one concerned about jeremy spiderman such a classic nice review looking forward to spiderman,0
honestly seeing that in the theatre as a kid was legendary,0
i was born in but i love it so much i can t stop praising this awesome movie,0
rewatching the movie again,0
honourable mention for the perfect casting of uncle ben and aunt may just so much heart depth brought to these movies thanks to these supporting characters and actors,0
i love spider man and the second one this movie is a superhero masterpiece i love it so much one of my favorite movies of all time,0
we need you to start streaming games on youtube or hosting watchparties on twitch,0
jeremy do a review on umbrella academy seasons,0
i just watched the cosmonaut variety hour s video on this trilogy and now you do a review on it nice,1
jeremy i always genuinely love your videos hearing about your passion for the movies as a projectionist was so endearing i hope you re doing well thank you for all that you do,0
great review so much nostalgia me being in my s now this trilogy was my childhood,0
wow i was just discussing earlier the sam raimi spider man trilogy with younger brother today we use to watch this movie all the time after we saw it theaters great review ans thanks for sharing your story,0
i m going to put some dirt in you re eye,0
r i p stan lee long live sam raimi s spiderman the best we had,0
spider man would have sucked already dragged a dead horse,0
love the beard,0
great beard rock it,0
jeremy sir that was perfect editing my man,1
i ve been waiting damn years for this review,0
jeremy do you think that this spider man movie has a lot of parallels to the superman like the fact that he has the alter ego by being a reporter photographer with a perry white like character for a boss wearing glasses the villain being a wealthy powerful ceo executive the adoptive father passing away and just little nods like the scene of him unbuttoning his shirt like clark kent all scream christopher reeve callbacks in a way haha,0
this will always be my spider man,0
do ben affleck daredevil,0
sam raimi s spider man is still the best adaptation in film and will probably never be topped it s a shame danny elfman s score was not even considered for an academy award nomination literally an instant operatic classical classic,0
the raimi trilogy will always be king there is no better spider man for me the mcu ones are okay at best with some entertaining sequences but they don t have the heart soul and fun of the s spider man toby forever,1
you should totally review eurovision i d love to see your reaction to it maybe you ll break out the apple juice i thought it was hilarious,0
what the hell i just had a raimi marathon with my friends today,1
finally,0
jeremy take of that hat please nice review i love the raimi trilogy the most because all the characters lookand act like they are in the comics they didn t change or swap race or make younger certain characters,0
i ve asked for a twin peaks review for years where is that video,0
hope your doing well jeremy,0
i was so down for everything about this film didn t care at all about organic web shooters and good lord raimi s spider man was one of the greatest sequels of all time absolutely empire strikes back dark knight in that it took everything that worked in the original and improved even more,0
you should absolutely watch and review both avatar the last airbender and the legend of korra now that they re both on netflix,0
review watchmen please,0
dam bro really,0
perks of being a wallflower pls,0
this is the movie that made me love movies,0
all this bullshit about peter parker making webslingers so therefore he is smart not even the military can make a device that shoot webs with tensile strength of steel cables hundreds of meters let alone a teenager lol what about the fact that in raimi s films doctor connor s class had real quantum mechanics like you know perturbation theory stuff that you actually learn in university and not some fake pseudoscience bs like magnets counter electricity in tasm that s not how electromagnetism works you fool,1
now do spider man,1
what i love about that eddie cameo when they mention him when the third one comes out they ve never met the dude lol they had a huge set up and nope,0
spider man isn t bad,0
hey jeremy gonna continue to ask if you could do a review spoiler talk for snowpiercer film especially cause its got a lot of social commentary that you like to talk about love your work man,0
listening to the video oh that s jeremy watching the video visible confusion,1
great video cant wait for reviews for and,0
this movie is not hold up but still have fond memories,0
love you,0
sure when some rando tells you to review spiderman you do it but when i ask you to watch the expanse i get ignored nice,0
probably gonna be overlooked but when i was at samoa around they replayed spider man and on tv almost every other day lol they loves these movies and shockingly was where i first watched them,0
oof so relatable,0
jeremy is gonna do spider man i ll die a happy man,0
jeremy review oldboy,1
spider man was an amazing movie and i feel it had the best blend of spider man peter parker life than the other movies i won t crap on the andrew garfield ones all that much because it had bits that i enjoyed just like i think tom holland brings that energetic nerdy vibe to the role but spider man just had more fun to it it was cheesy and it knew what it was and i m so glad you gave props to j k simmons because that man is the definition of perfect casting he was born to play that role the nd movie is the best though and it s one of the best superhero films period absolute gem the rd one was absolute flaming hot trash though and i hated every second of it the only thing it gave us were cringy gifs,0
i ve been waiting to hear your reviews about the sam raimi s spiderman trilogy yes it finally here and coming i have many memories back when i was in elementary school watching and growing up with these movies love your review and it s great to hear your experience with the film jeremy,0
review the good son can t go wrong with s,0
iconic yes good movie nope,0
better than mcu mcu feels lifeless and factory made,1
i always appreciated the biological reasoning for the webbing which funnily enough seemed more reasonable than a y o invented a thin gossamer thread which had more strength than steel only bc if the latter was the case then fuck being spider man save the world by becoming a multi million dollar industrialist and have a yacht for good measure,0
like spiderman love spiderman spiderman yeah we don t talk about it glad to know you re doing good,0
you should review boogie nights an underrated classic,0
we should not tell jeremy when pandemic is over,0
you should review some old terrible movies like water world or any movie madonna was in,0
i remember when spider man came out i was blown away on another note it suxs we will never see the amazing spider man,0
still the best spiderman tobey is it raimi did a great job just as good as spiderman really hoping they create the spiderverse with all of the movie spiderman that would be a great thing to watch,0
jermey u didn t say my name,1
binod love from india,0
can u review avatar the last airbender,0
only theme that has come close to danny elfman s spider man theme is sony s ps spider man theme,0
web shooters are the dumbest idea its like giving superman all his powers but flight and having him build a plane its dumb,0
if only spiderman was just about the sandman and peter god damn that would ve been so much better holy damn even picturing it seems way better,0
i forgot if it was honest trailer or another youtube channel but i wholeheartedly agree that willem dafoe is extremely awesome and terrifying without his costume if they redid bits and pieces of his costume of today s standards with his same exact acting from he d be up there with heath ledgers joker bold statement i know but that s my thought,0
jeremy looks like obi wan kenobi s emo phase,0
review attack on titan,0
spider man is my favorite one it s like watching a live action meme,1
back to formula sony,1
spider man is the most underrated entry in raimi s trilogy,1
i think the s cheese is more about the movie being a more of a comic book movie and not a superhero movie,1
obviously people would hate spiderman if he was real imagine sticky webs everywhere you go and you would hate him too,1
when i think of batman i think of the s tv show theme bu nu nu nu nu bu nu nu nu nu batman,0
rating predictions for the other sam raimi spider man movies spider man awesometacular spider man better time if you re drunk,0
i had to stop watching this and go see the trailer as i don t think i ever saw it by the time this came out on dvd my baby brother was in his i wanna watch the same movie times per day stage and this was the winner so that made that stage not suck so much for me i have always maintained that tobey was a great peter andrew was a great spidey and tom just nails both characters plus he actually looks like a teen defoe is truly more terrifying without the mask j jonah jameson was perfection my brother and i used to randomly quote him because why not yup still awesometacular in my book too bad they only made the two movies,0
put on a robe and lead a cult already we d love to join d,0
had this on vhs where it had that d thing on the front when the case moved spider man moved,0
willem dafoe s performance makes this movie for me he is so campy and memorable as the green goblin i am of the unpopular opinion that i absolutely love the goblin costume it s so badass,0
jeremy looking like al pacino s carlito brigante could you consider reviewing carlito s way if you haven t cheers,0
hell yea i was nervous when i clicked the video cause i know how some people hate the rami spider man s but i m glad you love it as much if not more than i do,0
can u review avatar the last airbender the series,0
i like your long hair,0
yeah i can wholeheartedly agree with this video while i have problems with it now since i know so much more about movies now than i did back then but even with that it doesn t take away from all the good feelings i have about it seeing if for the first time in theaters it was truly magical,0
yes i remember watching that same teaser trailer in too it was attached to a special preview screening of final fantasy the spirits within absolutely fantastic teaser that had me so pumped,1
jeremy should review the mentalist,0
one of the best comic book movies ever,0
never a huge fan of the suit what priceless,0
spiderman eddie s been on it for weeks spiderman you hired him a couple weeks ago,1
you were a projectionist in what are you,0
no mention of bruce campbell as a mysterio easter egg,0
good now you gotta do the next two or despite all you have done for us we will hate you,0
made the best horror franchise and the best spider man franchise hats off to mr raimi,0
wow we need more projectionist jeremy stories please,0
the best part of the marketing was the nickelback song so s and second grade me loved everything about the movie,0
i saw his post on instagram and was wondering if you were suggesting a review was coming a surprise to be sure but a welcome one,1
jeremy i m sure you won t get to this but i had a suggestion i felt i needed to share first this and all of your reviews are awesome i never miss them second i get why you re doing older movies that have been out for a while and honestly i love it almost as much as new movies so keep it up third and this my advice for movies that have been out for more than years you should just do a spoiler review i really wanted to hear what you thought about how everything ended and the big important moments anyways keep it up man love it you don t have to take my advice just thought i d share big fan,1
bonesaw is readieeeee,0
revisiting old films awesome just curious if your opinion has changed on the star wars prequels over the years,0
your wife s on the phone she lost your check book thanks for the good news jk simmons as jameson is perfection so perfect that they brought him back for the mcu screw spoilers it s been a year,1
man i loved back when trailers where actual trailers and not just full movie summaries with a please watch the movie tone,0
holy shit i remember this trailer i was eleven years old,0
break out of that spider man hate review the editor s cut it s way better and takes out key moments that original movie is always getting crap for,1
i can t convince everyone that tobey maguire was the best peter parker but his spider man was the best and kicked the most ass,1
can you please review welcome home the aaron paul movie,0
i m gonna place a like on your video,0
i will forever be grateful to my parents for showing me this movie,0
dude you look like keanu reeves,0
i worked at the theater at mall of america when this came out i best spiderman movie ever and i like the hero song,0
there s one comic where spider man is old and jjjameson knows his secret identity and is a massive fanboy so excited that he knows spider man,0
this was the only spider man i went to see guess i m just not a spider fan,0
looking straight wolfie here bro,0
i really enjoyed this when i first saw it in theaters and still think it is one of the best spider man movies the recent ones are really good in a different way but i still prefer the first two sam raimi ones nice shout out to barnes noble i was working there when this movie came out and remember seeing a review of it in one of the newspapers they used to sell by the magazine stands those many many years ago,1
don t go yet me too late story of my life,0
que the nickleback song the song that let s face it a lot of us year old s loved and admit we still do,0
i love spider man it was really awesome and badass,0
minute talk about spiderman must click,0
not gonna talk about how the final fight between spider man and green goblin is brutal and epic as fuck,0
if you read all the comments then preach and act what you say everyone wants you to heart this comment,0
love the editing of this video,1
j k simmons just appears in every animated show i watch now this guy voice tenzin and lenny turtleatub with knowing that he s also this absurd j jonah jameson,0
you should review the first x men films,0
that final fight scene with gg in the abandoned building was brutal plus showing spider man never giving up even when he got the s t beat out of him to finally come out on top was awesome love this movie from start to finish,0
raimi s spider man will forever be my favourite superhero film for me it s perfection it was the first comic book movie i saw when i was about and i still love watching that movie till this day also love the second one of course,0
jeremy s thoughts literally mirror mine i was years old when spiderman released and my feelings will never change,1
the new spidey movies sucks,0
best origin story in a live action superhero movie period heck even i m more of a dc guy but i have to take my hat off to this,0
these movies really have such heart for me they really capture the s spider man tone something s haven t aged well but these movies just make you feel good,0
i will never get over this trilogy yes spiderman as well still appreciate it,0
all of it s wallpapers were bangers sony knows how to make wallpapers,1
the editors cut of spider man is almost as good as spider man and has some of the best scenes in the entire movie ip,0
if you read the comments review starship troopers,0
it wasn t that jk simmons played the perfect jj jameson it was that jj jameson decided to shed his costume playing jk simmons everyday for these movies,0
one of the few comic book movies that had a very touching deeply sad death spider man uncle bens death logan professor xs death avengers endgame tony starks death,1
i lawled so hard at the reaction following they re gonna bring venom it s gonna be so awesome also jk simmons is easily the best jjj,1
do my eyes deceive me or is jeremy finally reviewing the rami spider man movies,1
kool fucking beard dude keep it growing,0
looking more like keanu everyday my friend seattle s finest,1
jeremy jahns is the mvp of movie reviewers,0
also the with great powers comes great responsibility message was really absorbed by the audience,0
finally,0
gotta say i love the fully bushy beard,0
i was or when i saw the trailer for this play during a football game i lost my mind and ran around the house shouting about the movie,0
this quote is still the most iconic villian quote in a movie this is why only fools are heroes because you never know when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice let die the woman you love or suffer the little children make your choice spider man and see how a hero is rewarded,0
please do videos for spider man and,0
dude its been a year if someone don t know that s on them,0
all he needs is a full black suit and boom john wick,1
this is the only movie i ever saw the midnight release for,0
did you read this comment,0
my favorite of the trilogy yes i like it more then spider man,0
spider man is the greatest hero movie of all time,0
dude that beard is so thick,0
,0
jeremy looks like kylo ren in the duel of the fates concept art,1
please review mute on netflix i m curious on what you think,1
ah i was a year old back in,0
can you review spawn please hbo series or the michael jai white movie i don t care,0
spider man isn t a terrible movie it s a decent movie it s a below average spider man movie and does cringey ish things to its cast it s a bit messy of film but not as bad going back,0
jeremy he was so good that changes mind no spoilers good save dude,1
honestly hope you enjoy spider man more upon rewatch jeremy that film is extremely underrated imo not perfect but fantastic but definitely underrated,0
so you were a projectionist at age,0
jeremy looks like he could be a foreign bad guy from a mid s movie,0
your hair s outta control,0
i loved the movie but hated and to this day hate tobi maquire as peter parker doesn t look or act like him peter was a nerd because he was smart and into science not because he s a goofy dork like they portray him in this movie i hate seeing toby s dumb face with his terrible acting but the movie is overall is so well done i still loved it,0
when jjj refuses to give up peter even though his life was on the line was amazing you learn so much about him as a person so quick on rewatches i tear up a little,1
i can t wait for your spiderman review,0
you know something i m kind of a movie reviewer myself,0
the hair looks epic jeremy,0
he looks like cap from infinity war,0
please review the first toy stories,1
the first two spider man movies will always be my favorites,0
there was a more realistic goblin design but it did not tested well on kids as it scared them too much,0
for years i ve been wanting jeremy to review the spider man movies sad that it took the virus to give us this,0
you know i m something of a scientist myself,1
i seen spider man at least once a year since,0
i was a sophomore in high school when this came out and i remember how big of a deal it was it was the movie to watch my hometown had a very small theatre one screen and it was in there every weekend for a couple of months they played the more family friendly movies during the day and played spiderman in the evenings that way the other movies that came out during that time were still watched,0
he still seems alittle off,0
funny story i watched it in the cinema with my pops when i was five years old but it was subtitled non english speaker here i later watched it dubbed but i still remember my anguish as the police officer tried to arrest spidey during the building on fire scene i remember being all he s the good guy don t do it no wonder spider man is my favorite marvel superhero great vid as always jeremy now on to training day please d,1
i didn t know you were not a bad thing just a weird thing,0
i will always love this film i watched it so many times as a kid and to this day the revenge sequence when peter goes after uncle ben s killer remains my favorite spider man sequence ever put to film the action itself is pretty decent but the film nails the emotion behind it perfectly raimi s directing maguire s acting and elfman s awesome revenge musical cue all combine to make an action sequence that hits me in the feels unlike anything else,0
man i remember seeing spider man at universal studios hollywood when i was a teenager,1
i see where you were going,0
of all the movies this one was more like a live action comic book the love of the source material is evident in almost all of the choices made even now it s one of the best marvel movies,0
wait jeremy how old are you if you were a projectionist in that suggests you re in your late s or even early s but you look like you re in your late s or early s are you a vampire,0
yeah man great movie,0
great review and great hair,0
my first superhero movie after s batman my first superhero movie i watched in the theater blew my mind,0
sam raimi s spiderman trilogy had so much emotion action and heart that no other spiderman movie could replicate,1
projectionist in hold up how damn old is jeremy,1
i ll take raimi or tasm over mcu spider man,0
this is my favorite movie please do the other ones,0
the ending the ending at the cemetery it broke me but it was so perfect,1
wasn t expecting him to review one of my childhood favorite movies cheers mate,0
what about napoleon dynamite,0
if jeremy reviews spider man i really hope he doesn t shit on it just for the sake of shitting on it there are good elements in spiderman and it ultimately disappointed because of studio interference so i hope he gives it a fair review,1
everybody we need a review on sam raimi s spiderman trilogy jeremy i missed the part where it s my problem,1
it s been years already damn time sure flies by so fast,0
it s super cool living in the day and age where jesus reviewing a spider man movie,0
my favorite spider man movie i prefer it much more over spider man,0
tobey maguire is peter parker all of his lines land perfectly in this movie as exactly as it does in the comics,1
spiderman and are still the best spiderman films to date iron man jr in the mcu doesn t even come close,0
first movie i ever saw in the movies as a kid i will never forget it,0
his hair has a face in it,1
dude you look like a bad ass wizard,0
couldn t have said it better well done jeremy,0
the mcu spiderman doesn t feel like spiderman sam rami did a perfect job capturing who spiderman is,0
hey jeremy i know you re there reading me,0
jeremy social media was not a thing at the time imdb message boards am i a joke to you,1
wtf why is keanu reeves reviewing spider man where s jeremy,0
i remember the day i saw the trailer for this movie i was years old in the living room playing spider man sinister for game boy color i was playing the sand man construction level and i hear my mother mention spider man on tv i didn t know what she was talking about and just brushed it off as i was moving my comics to the side and then my mom just runs to me and says look i see the trailer and couldn t believe i was gonna see a spider man movie so early in my life time after seeing the s spider man cartoon unlimited reading comics and all i could think man there s no way a spider man movie could happen sfx wouldn t catch up but man was it a welcomed surprise and it opened the door to where we are now after blade and x men but spider man was the movie that showed you can do colorful costumes and suspend belief and little did we know the mcu was only a small time away,0
shoot it out of his ass which i was bummed out in my jeremy jahns headcanon that was intentional,0
spiderman is actually not that bad messy but still entertaining,0
do the trilogy dammit,0
that trailer was epic when you first saw it in theaters then hence the ott scene where spider man lands by the patriotism,0
spider man also had the first jump scare i d ever experienced and it scared the living shit out of me last night i was dun,0
hold up you were a projectionist how old are you,0
wolverine jahns,0
also it was important that they kept the iconic spider man suit remember that for all the other movies in this time period they were changing the suits to black leather this movie made it ok for the hero to wear bright colors and look like the comic,0
i miss the suits,0
man this review just took me back to a time when things were fun yet simple music was high energy games were amazing and the movies were an experience damn i miss the late s early s,1
you ll often hear burton fanboys claim that without batman nolan s trilogy wouldn t exist even though nolan never once cited burton as inspiration but spider man is the movie that turned comic book movies into cultural movements,1
toby maguire walked so tom holland could run,1
the rooftop scene and that brutal final final are one of my favorite scenes from the trilogy,0
you re doing spider man right the greatest comic book movie of all time,0
i may not remember the movie it was but i remember the first time i saw that trailer i squeaked a little out of joy then the movie came out and i remember thinking it was alright it has some good parts and the casting of jk simmons and william defoe could carry it i never bought tobey maguire and kristin dunst as good choices tobey never came out off as the super smart nerd or as a joke cracking wise ass hero and as much as i loved kristin as a actress she couldn t pull off the super sexy model actress that mj is and with the green goblin armor and ruining the sadistic choice that goblin does i just was never a fan,0
could you please review the dc animated movies such as batman under the red hood dark knight returns and batman vs robin i would greatly appreciate it,0
love this review i found it funny that you stopped yourself from stating any spoilers this was is one of my favorite spider man movie great review,0
i remember this was the first film i seen in cinema i brought my teddy and came home drawing spiderman for months,0
just pay most attention to the sandman bits when watching spider man and you should make it through okay,0
hey jeremy you should watch hitopfilms video essay on spiderman before you rewatch i still don t like but i can see elements of great within from what he brought up in his video,0
if you review spider man please use the play station pizza time musics for the title card,0
spider man was the first superhero movie i ever saw it resonated with me for my whole life spider man became my favorite superhero before superman and batman took center stage but spider man never left this movie made me feel like i could be a hero it made me feel like i could be spider man i think what i appreciate alot about this movie is it was a movie first and a superhero movie second if that makes sense today we are so used to superhero movies with dc and especially with the mcu but back then superhero movies were uncommon or just automatic failures then spider man changed everything it wasn t trying to set up a universe or drop easter eggs least not in your face it was a story about a boy whose life is changed and he learns how to become not just a man but a hero,0
the norman what clipped killed me i love that clip with no context,0
loved this movie hope they go back this kind of spider man one day,0
could you review the spider man game,0
jeremy looks like a young john glover with all that hair and bush,0
do the sequels,0
spider man is a masterpiece and holds up perfectly in,0
i totally understand what u mean when ever i see this spiderman it takes me bk to that time i can reallllly relate,0
yesssss finallly been waiting on this,0
i think jeremys hair beard gets longer and longer every new review,0
was hoping for some love towards macho man randy savages lovely character in this film,0
haha i like how the security guard is named clint and his real name is clint culp,0
please tell us you will review the rest of the movies,0
i want you to do a review on the telltale batman season,0
love the film but the reddit community have really damped my experience of them similar to r prequelmemes the cult like following has gone very extreme to the point where they think they film cannot be critiqued and any criticism should be met with name calling random quotes usually just i m gonna put dirt in your eye and an overall insecurity that some people like any other spider man flick it s a shame these enjoyable campy super hero films have to have such shit fans but that s most fandoms i guess,0
it s such a great movie i like the second one a bit more sad how they messed it up with,1
continue with the trilogy bro,1
froggernoob says obama lol,0
ya know i m something of a lip reader myself,0
and other important things the raimi spiderman is not afraid to say with great power comes great responsibilty which is his key phrase and encompases him completly and his motiviation to do what he does is fully triggered by him not doing the right thing and his guilt for him in a way that gets his uncle killed and not to idolize tony stark and just do it cause reasons do they ever say why peter picks up the mantle in the disney sony movies both points make me always be a bit less invested in the newer spiderman movies im ignoring spiderman for the moment p,0
can you review kill bill vol not many reviews for those movies available,0
i always loved how in this spiderman movie there are little scenes where new yorkers talk about spiderman and that scene when sm saves the trolley and they start throwing junk at green goblin it makes it feel like a snapshot of pre ny,0
jurassic bro i remember it well as well they pulled it off the vhs of knights tale we had to replace all the copies at blockbuster and the movie got pushed a couple days for it to release because of it it came out either right before or right after,0
can you review the tax collector pls,0
i think the holland movies are technically the best movies with spider man but the maguire movies are the best spider man movies there s just so much magic that can never be replicated,0
the movie was good for the most part and sure it has some meh acting and some great ones as you said but i would probably watch it if i catch it on tv having said that in my opinion the tone was too much for kids and that s probably the bigest problem for me plus later when i saw the incredible green goblin mask they don t use so well but overall it was good not great but good enough,0
honestly jeremy this was one of your best reviews in a long time not that i don t like your other reviews i do but hearing all your personal stories about it and your honest insight into a movie that has weirdly gotten looked upon negatively in retrospect was awesome as someone who often stands up for movies not everyone enjoys i love it when people can just be open and honest about something that means something to them so go you,0
review the one with jet li,1
you should review the invisible guest amazing spanish movie,0
clicked on the video to hear serpico talk about spiderman,0
finally lfg,0
does this mean that we ll get that bioshock infinite spoiler review eventually,0
back then i was blown away by this movie when it was released in and as a spider man fan i still enjoy til the day i die plus you can t think of spider man without danny elfman s theme intro,1
lol jeremy looking like king ecbert from vickings,0
jeremy never cut that hair or beard off epic,0
i don t is as bad as a lot of people make it out to be is it the weakest in the trilogy definitely is there some cringe that was bad even by mid s standards you know it did it have too many villains and a focus on venom and harry would have been a better choice without a doubt why am i still defending this right at least its better than the amazing spider man movies and even though eric foreman wouldn t have been my th choice for eddy brock we still got venom in the end it s a better time if you re drunk and maybe add a lil something extra on top valium makes anything better from my experience,0
i have never understood the hate for spider man its just like the st films the trilogy is a package,0
review a goofy movie please,0
you re not spoiling something that came out a year ago,1
jj doesn t lie to the goblin because he cares about peter as a person he lied because if the goblin kills peter then he won t be able to get any more photos of spider man,0
ya know after watching oz i cant see jk as jjj anymore,0
inspite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you that quote basically applies to everybody who grew up with this spider man and then hated it when they saw andrew garfield spider man,1
this was one of the first movies my family got when we got our first dvd player we had the disc version with all the behind the scenes and extra features and i watched the crap out of that stuff i freakin love this movie please do spider man and p s i really wish the studio didn t interfere with the rd one could ve been a perfect trilogy,1
i knew jk simmons was perfect because of his work as schllinger on oz man that was a dark show,0
minutes of review and jeremy didn t say with great power comes great responsibility,0
a friend of mine said the goblin suit looks like a power ranger damn you ken now that s all i see,1
i love the green goblin suit childhood favorite,0
every review should start with you shall not passss,0
i remember putting in the vhs and just being in awe of what i watched whenever i watch it i always call kirsten dunst the screamer i remember thinking at the time i was watching it they should give her an award for best scream,0
the cheese that is spiderman will never mold,0
the raimi spider man movies are my spider man movies everything that came after meh,1
jeremy christ jesus jahns,0
we ll meet again spiderman is older cheese it reminded me of the spiderman cartoons from the s i like to think it was intentional,1
woooooooow if i only wished paradise man last weekend i was watching spider man on tv and i was thinking what is mr jahns opinion about it this trilogy hold a special place in my movie library along with desperado,0
yes jeremy you know what s up i still have mad love for this film saw it when i was and it blew my friggin mind i liked spider man beforehand but this film reinforced it tenfold the main aspects i loved was the web swinging and music seeing spidey swing around new york running on the side of buildings and flipping in the air magical and that elfman score doesn t get enough credit it s so good and that main theme is one of my all time favourites,0
this review is long overdue,1
jeremy ive asked over and over again please review the lighthouse,0
i was when this came out,0
these movies are bad,0
despite everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you exactly what the media has done keeps doing to michael jackson,0
do spider man too get it too i ll stop now,0
glad he s ok,0
the teaser trailer was attached to jurassic park,0
the cgi was bad even for,0
toby great peter parker andrew great spiderman personality tom best of both worlds,1
i ve always loved the third one i would say give it another shot,0
jeremy could you please please please do a series review of farscape,0
he stinks and i dont like him,0
i was born in i loved spiderman media in any form this movie blew my mind that last fight scene was my favorite part so dark and for the lack of a better term realistic ig ughh this movie soo much nostalgia spiderman is my all time favorite superhero,0
omg now i wanna see a live action spider verse movie with all the original cast from all the movies and a resurrected willem dafoe as norman osborn that would be an amazing spider man,0
if you read the comments then it s time u review a serbian film,0
i am glad this came out on my birthday love spider man and a fan of your reviews can i get a birthday shout out,0
i wonder what jeremy was gonna say at before he stopped himself,1
it would be awesome if you could watch spiderman de directors cut,0
they only made one sequel,0
i saw that guy commenting on the instagram post he got his wish,0
well done jeremy r b jahns well done i actually choked up twice from your review thanks j,0
mountain man jeremy,0
now plz do spiderman,0
it s and i was my dad took me to the movies to see some random movie i dont remember but after the movie was done and we were leaving we walked by a poster of spider man and i had to do a double take and my eyes lit up like the moon while my dad kept walking he turned around to get me and see what i was staring at lol,1
i definitely remember loving the teaser trailer too nice insight for your love for this movie but i wish you thwip ed at the end of the video,0
the original trailer was incredible way way back on quicktime,0
speaking of witch can you do a superman review,0
jeremy review batman beyond return of the joker,0
we don t talk about spider man,0
the spider man trilogy well the first two anyway are some of the best comic book movies ever made,1
my brain melted right before or after i shit myself jeremy jahns,0
magical times love the original but part is the best and batman begins is the best superhero film ever made i like chicken,0
i had my first date ever at the age of and she wanted to go to the movies so we went to spider man and about halfway through the movie she left because i was actually watching the movie instead of giving her attention i didn t even notice her leaving until the lights went on for the midway break,1
i was i had the exact reaction to the first trailer,0
sam raimi spider man is best spider man,0
jeremy writing his reviews me jeremy jeremy stop stop what are you doing jahns you re late man always late jeremy i m sorry mr aziz i had another review to do me review another review it s always for you c mon years ago in comes customer sam raimi delivers to the fanbase extra ordinary in depth movies about their friendly neighborhood spider man and you re supposed to review them but if you re not in time not only am i going to make no satisfaction from watching your reviews but i will lose sam forever and chris stuckmann s gonna take him alright you have to make it in time go jeremy i wont let you down starts running to deliver the review and realises he s running out of time suddenly he darts for the alleyway and we cut to the black guy looking up out comes jesus spider man jeremy wooooooooohoooooooooo black guy woah he stole that guy s review,1
butterfly effect ashton kutcher please,0
spider man is just fantastic,0
as a die hard spider man fan i have to say that no matter who plays the role and no matter how good or how bad the movie is i will always find some enjoyment in a spider man film this includes spider man and tasm and i have a tremendous amount of love and respect for tobey maguire andrew garfield and tom holland for playing my favorite superhero of all time but with all that being said my favorite spider man actor is and always will be tobey maguire simply cause seeing him as spider man or more specifically peter parker was the thing that really made me fall in love with everything comic books cause well he was a kid a teenager in high school with high school problems and i loved that i always say that tobey s spider man was my first love of comic books like i have a special place in my heart for his spider man and his movies i mean as much as i love homecoming and into the spider verse my personal all time favorite spider man movie will always be raimi s spider man like to this day i still get chills and sit at the edge of my seat when i see the train scene i love tom holland and andrew garfield in the role so much i really do but there s just something about tobey s movies that just idk hits different for me you know long story short tho is tobey will always be my favorite no matter what whatever life holds in store for me i will never forget these words with great power comes great responsibility this is my gift my curse who am i i m spider man,0
you look like a real chetnik lately,0
no shout out for randy savage how dare you,0
you know i m something of a smart myself,0
have you bought the k trilogy set it looks great i watched them a couple of months ago,0
thank you i always think about that scene but nobory talks about it,1
this movie has so many great scenes emotional and impactful it has humor fun and so much heart everything a spider man movie should have,0
the most important part as spider man as a super hero movie was we had to see him swinging in daylight batman is at night and you can cheat just show him landing and the audience fills in the blank in spider man we needed to see him swing between buildings elevated a new standard in super hero movies,0
i remember seeing that trailer before final fantasy and needless to say it was easily better than the movie i paid to see,0
is jahns bringing back the middle part,0
i got you fur threee minutes three minutes of plaaayyytiiimee,1
ive ever felt so ed at the beginning,0
i ve watched this movie close to times and i never caught the eddie brock easter egg,1
way better than the shitty tom holland movies,0
so when is your production of jesus christ superstar begin,0
best spider man ever,0
this movie changed the superhero genre and changed spider man and spidey fans going forward i will always love this movie perfect casting storytelling and one of the greatest superhero movies sam raimi was truly a spidey fan,0
is it an official thing that you re never gonna do snyder s watchmen i know you briefly talked about it on your old show but we need a genuine jahns review,0
constantine movie review,0
jeremy what are the chances you could review some of your favorite drinks,0
green goblin is just epic william dafoe is such amazing seller he can nearly sell any role he is in also anyone remember that mtv spoof they did of spiderman with jack black,0
palm springs st attempt,1
i also was a projectionist union assistan manager in in lobby when occurred,0
the biggest flaw in the movie is gobbie s mask the unmoving plastic completely blocking the actor s ability to emote everything else about the character and portrayal is perfect,0
lol jeremy can i say you look just like severus snape but with a beard,1
jeremy says he read comments then when is my review of the abyss and terminator i watching you jahns one day one day those reviews shall be mine muahahahhahahahahahaha i need to get out of my house,1
i was when this movie came out here in sweden and i ve had dreamed of a real spiderman since forever remember visiting my dad and watching tv for breakfast and suddenly this movie trailer comes up and i have a heart attack i was so hyped that i nagged my dad to see it in the cinema the same evening,0
please review the amazing spider man i don t read the comics but i thought it was the best spider man movie the romance the cgi the swinging scenes the dialogue the pacing and character interactions seems better to me the character motivations seem more realistic than this spider man too idk if it s just that it doesn t follow the comics faithfully and that s why people hate it because it seems like a better movie objectively to me,0
spider man is the best one ever,0
the bridge scene is my favourite scene of all time,0
i forgot how the theme went and starting humming it then remembered instantly,0
now that sam raimi is going to direct doctor strange i m excited to watch it,0
meat i ll send you a nice box of christmas meat best i can do jameson spin off series where he just runs the paper yelling things make it happen,0
you read comments lies review the crow you take requests right haha,0
best movie this,0
this is the only spiderman i really liked,0
first time i ever ditched class was to go see the showing at the movie theater across the street from school,0
best review yet,0
i don t think jeremy knows how entertaining he is to watch talk,1
you should review heat,0
spider man exists year old me spider man still exists adult me,1
i saw that political nod there jeremy i see you,0
watch the editor s cut of spider man,0
jeremy is slowly transforming into wolverine,1
i just watched this movie for like the th time before he posted this video,0
completely agree with the iconic quality of sam raimi s vision as an important point my daughter who is now has seen every iteration and she always says tobey was the best raimi s quirky style was seemlessly matched by tobey and that style should be somewhat present or used on every comic based movie hmmm what a great consultant he could be,0
are going to get a review of the evil dead trilogy next,0
review red dead redemption,0
i don t know if it was this movie or the second one but there was supposed to be a cameo of hugh jackman as wolverine however due to some miss scheduling they couldn t get the proper costuming and it never happened,1
dude you gotta watch spider man as an action comedy raimi was fed up with the studio telling him what he had to do so he said fuck it and did spider man army of darkness style the cringe moments in are meant to be funny you don t think raimi laughed at the dancing scenes i m telling you man people watch with the wrong eyes,0
as long as you make these reviews i will continue to watch them keep doing what you re doing jeremy you re awesome,0
i would recite the words as the movie played as a kid when i had it on vhs,0
the only spiderman movies i like bring hack toby lol,0
spider man was great back then because we hadn t seen anything like it but with all the superhero movies out now it doesn t really hold up as well as it used to,0
if quentin tarintino directed a saruman prequel story this guy is the perfect cast,1
macho man randy savage was the greatest cameo you aint goin nooooowhere i got you for three rounds three minutes of playtime,0
spider man is my favorite spider man movie plus the game was awesome,0
oh boy yeah i ve been waiting for this,0
please watch and review dark netflix it s a great show and i d love to hear your thoughts d,0
you should review snatch for even more early s nostalgia,0
day asking jeremy to finally review play alien isolation,1
don t shave,0
fans sony why are you waiting for microsoft to drop your ps price point sony we re not we re just not ready to reveal that fans your lyyyiinngg,1
about damn time,0
and a couple months later happened oh jeremy we both know that didn t happen,1
these first two spider man movies are still the epitome of comic book movies for me the perfect blend between drama and comedy the action is fantastic and often brutal like the final fight with green goblin the score is iconic and at its core it focuses most on character easily this and its sequel destroy all other spider man movies that came after i also really hope you review the sequel because i think it s even better than this original great review jeremy,0
holy shit i stopped watching jj some time ago and now he s fucking wolverine,0
still waiting for your bioshock infinite spoiler review,1
you look like moses,0
i still think james franco would have been a better peter parker and tobey maguire would have been a better harry osborn tobey maguire and willem dafoe look like they could be father and son,0
my favorite superhero was getting a live action movie in theaters and i already had my year old nephew hooked on spidey i was so pumped taped the tv trailer with my vhs and watch it constantly i was laid off from work so i got to see the first showing at am on that friday and funny enough there were mostly senior citizens getting tickets then i realize these are spider man fans from way back some were teenagers when spidey first appeared in comics they get to see this film with a great budget and special effects and direction that the s show didn t have the movie satisfied me on a level i could only dream lol i was that much in love with spider man like so many others in the world since a wee child in the late s comics cartoons video games and now this couldn t believe i get to witness this no matter how much more i like the current or future spidey portrayal and movies the rami series and everyone involved with always have a place in my heart,0
peter wasn t smart but he was the science boy,1
i completely agree the acting the writing and the characters were so great and the music i think the cgi still holds up now compared to the cartoony looking rubber cgi we get now this is still my favorite spider man yet spider man was awesome but i still like the first one the best the new disney spider man suck,0
summer of i was years old will never forget i d already been reading superhero comics and became enamored with the cartoons but seeing spider man in live action on a colossal screen so close i thought i could touch him that was nothing short of a religous experience,0
you should review the blade trilogy next the mcu wouldn t be what it is today without it,0
you re slowly turning into a werewolf with all that hair,0
i legit coincidentally watched this movie today since it s my favorite movie of all time and then this showed up in my reccomended,0
jk simmons no spoilers,1
the most shocking is the causual amazing sewing skills,0
review the keanu reeves constantine movie please,0
back when homecoming was coming out they rereleased a blu ray collection for all the past spider man films and the coolest of part of it was tht they released an editors cut for spider man and it s pretty interesting not a lot of changes but it s still interesting to watch least i thought it was,0
i actually have that exact mm film trailer on my shelf,1
review umbrella academy,0
did they ever explain why peter parker had organic web shooters instead of mechanical ones in the comic books,0
i remember waiting in line for this movie when i was six years old with my family the first showing was already half way done so we waited for the second showing we heard cheers from the audience every few minutes and with each clap shout and whistle i got more and more excited it took my level of psyched to a level that i had never felt before and have rarely felt since,1
i too remember seeing the spider man teaser trailer in the theatre pretty awesome,0
i seriously have to thank you for all the great content you create i always look forward to seeing your videos and hearing your input keep up the great work how about a starship troopers review,0
i watched this movie when i was years old i played the spiderman game on ps this movie is what got me hooked on superhero movies and culture grew up on these movies and i will always love them,0
wonderful movie,0
bonesaw is readdyyy,0
this was awesome seeing your love please review spiderman,0
review superhero movie pleaseee,0
did anyone else just stare at jeremy s two gray hairs on the side of his face,0
this was my introduction to spider man along with the s cartoon and it s still my favorite spider man film it s so colorful goofy heartfelt and even dark in some places like you said despite certain inaccuracies and the odd dated cg effect it still embodies the tone of spider man all these years later plus i think it nailed the weight to certain events uncle ben s death has still never been done better and the green goblin in this film i still feel is the best villain in a spidey film and one of the all time great comic book film villains with how evil and threatening he is to spider man doc ock vulture and mysterio are still great too,1
will always be the best,0
grab your whiskey its story time,0
let s not forget the reason the third movie is a smelly pile of turd is the executives at sony crapping the pot spider man is awesome to this day loveit,0
poor jeremy i think the world situation has made him lose his mind or at least his razor anyway a little cheese isn t bad especially in a comic movie hell most comic movies these days could use a bit more of it instead of taking themselves so seriously these are based on throwaway magazines they re not high art this is a great movie thanks for the retrospective jeremy i hope they send barbers to whatever underground bunker you re living in,0
thank you for finally reviewing this,0
the best fuvking spider man,0
ytp spider man could you pay me in advance snance i m sorry but this is more funny then the movie,0
you forgot about james franco,0
please review happy season on netflix,0
i didn t request this but i was so happy to see this video,0
i would love for an alternate version of this spider man s anatomy where he indeed shoots the webbing directly out of his asshole hole cut in suit and everything in fact it would probably make me like super hero movies of which i currently loathe,0
jeremy i just want to say your beard suits you especially with your hair you should keep it that way,0
need to do more classics like this and i don t just mean superhero movies,1
inow i wanna play spider man ps again for the th time i just saw a look back video on bill and ted and and was reminded they have weird gay joke in there and i thought how weird it would be to have that same thing happen here,1
this is why i got no girls worth it right looking back no it wasn t at the time it was who i was so fuck it i guess it was worth it,0
everyone hates three but i thought it was ok i just think we hate it because we think of what it could ve been but it s still good,1
i re watched not too long ago very early into the re watch my thought was nope still hate it and it brought back all of those feelings of disappointment that i felt in the mid aughts first with x men then superman returns and then spiderman as the cherry on top of the hit sundae for superhero movies that was i turned the movie off and never looked back,0
it s so satisfying watching a video about a movie you love and you sit here like yeah it s great isn t it,0
so perfect that he s no spoilers nevermind,1
it was james cameron s idea to make spider man shooting webs organic instead of him making them,1
please review spider man and next jeremy,0
i m gonna count hours till you do spider man,0
jeremy is somebody i just want to grab a drink with,0
what about watchmen,0
i still remember going to see this with my sixth grade class and sitting in the very front row when the trailer for ang lee s hulk played,0
this has actually always been my favorite spider man movie since i was a kid upon rewatch this year i now prefer the second one but this one s always going to have a special place in my heart,0
review who killed captain alex movie its in youtube free to watch,0

every time i see jeremy now i just picture him as keanu reeves stunt double in the john wick movies he even started to sound like john wick a few times in this video,0
can we get spiderman and now,0
we need number,0
now you gotta do spider man,0
i personally didn t like the raimi trilogy in it s entirety but i will say that j k simmons willem dafoe are iconic as j jonah jameson norman osborn respectively and i can t get enough of their scenes,0
does anybody else smile and get misty eyed when he gives a movie an awesometacular rating no just me i don t care love the passion jeremy,0
your hair is glorious oh yeah thanks for the spider man review appreciate it,0
spiderman is quite possibly the best superhero film ever made,1
jk simmons killed it,0
i really wish you talked about how violent the climax was i loved that,0
i m going to go watch the trailer brb,0
just thank you jeremy little bit choked as this was the movie that kicked off a love for spiderman years later and a sh t load of comics just whooooo yeah,0
i don t buy for a second that jeremy didn t get chicks in high school,1
compare the themes and story in this movie to the holland movies its not even in the same league,1
the toby series is still my favorite spider man this was light hearted fun action movie with good characters what more can you ask for and we get willem dafoe doing a damn good job as always,0
i still love it cgi still holds up for the most part and there is some camp but overall i still think it s great,0
i love spiderman sue me,0
i absolutely adore all three spider man films,0
no spoilers nvrmnd,0
my ranking of all the spiderman movies spiderman spiderman into the spiderverse spiderman spiderman far from home homecoming the amazing spiderman the amazing spiderman,1
actually the first review for jeremy that i saw was for andrew garfield s amazing spiderman so its nice to finally see your take on the first live action spiderman can t wait for the trilogy review,0
dude not being a asshole but for some reason when i saw you i expected you holding a stuff and splitting the ocean in half but i love your reviews man i hope your doing will,0
much better then any of the current spider man movies i still think the first one is far better then any of tom holland s tobys the,1
i only love sandman on spider man yep just that one xd,0
as someone who was a kid in the early s raimi s spiderman movies were the first time i ever saw a superhero on the big screen they introduced me to a hero that felt real and relatable who was someone who i could believe in,1
mcu spider man is like snarf for thundercats mr staaark mr staaark,1
i was when the movie came out i got a spider man shirt and went to see it it was awesometacular,1
man the scene when uncle ben dies and peter hears the police say they are following the killer on the streets and the music kicks on and he goes after him that shit still gives me goosebumps,0
i respect this film a lot more than i like it i think a lot of people like this more from a nostalgic perspective which is fair enough but of all the spiderman movies these are my least favourite and has my least favourite on screen portrayal of spiderman that said jk simmons perfection,0
into the spiderverse is the only spidey movie since that has even remotely come close to giving me the same feeling that st raimi movie did i ll never forget going to my local theater on opening day with my dad when i was years old in may the audience stood up and clapped when the credits rolled and i ve never had a moment recreated quite like that in my life it will always be the supreme spiderman film in my heart for that reason,0
re review inception,0
jeremy i love ya as a viewer but you have got to shave,0
hey jeremy watching spiderman and what would you have done different for the third movie what should they have to make the perfect trigoly,0
they were all cgi spider man from that point onward hell even mcu spider man is iron man it is what it is i guess nuff said,0
july that s the month i was born just wanted to mention it,1
you gota atleast do a video of the legacy of kain jeremy,0
review of one of my fave superhero movies on my birthday,0
hey is that a young hans gruber,0
bonesaw anyone else,0
one of my favorite movies from my childhood also the projectionist story was much appreciated,0
keep the look jeremy,0
jeremy i don t wanna bore you with this personal sidebar story me shut up and tell us all the tales you beautiful wolverine kenobi reeves,1
i love the whole trilogy and yes even part and yes even the dance scenes lol,0
the sam raimi spider man trilogy are still the best spider man films imo yes even spidey despite it s flaws,1
this spider man was the first spider man that i was introduced to i remember watching tv in the living room and a spider man trailer came out the most memorable part was spidey doing acrobatics vs the thugs mary jane scene kiss scene my dumbass thought that his hand sign was the index and middle finger instead of the two middle fingers i later found out that wasn t the case through the animated series,1
sam raimi spiderman movies will always have a special place in the heart of cinema history,0
who s with me in the wish that jeremy turns the last video into a series,0
i used to give tobey s spider man crap because of how whiny i thought he made the character be i had no idea that the ones that would follow would be much much worse the only thing current spidey has going for him are his quips but outside of that he s no spider man he s iron man jr and i miss the riami spider man,1
after this movie came out me and my friend would always shout we ll meet again spider man when we left the others house,1
sam raimi s spider man s will always be the best sorry tom holland,1
idk i was only like or when this movie came out and i grew up watching all three of the spider man movies when i got older i started reading the comics and managed to get copied prints of the originals to me these spider man movies made peter to be a freaking loser like yea he s a nerd and had bullies but idk he just seemed pathetic in these movies for me the best peter parker is from the s spider man cartoon just my opinion,0
jahns absolutely sam raimi s spider man still remain awesometacular,0
i didnt know i wanted needed this thanks dude ol fella x,0
tobey is the best spider man william dafoe was mind blowing,1
and now we wait for spider man and spider man reviews,0
bonesaw,0
willem is the king of cheese,0
the teaser was attached to final fanyasy the spirits within the teaser with the twin towers,1
i think if spider man was real you would ether love him or not like in the game ie the best spider man movie,0
i hate that horrible movie,0
please pleaseeeee do a review for gangs of london,0
even though it has flaws it s still a great spider man movie,0
man looking like hugh jackman,0
nostalgic and interesting,0
jeremy review back to the future part and or the shawshank redemption,0
this will always be a great movie especially for someone like me who s was around during the s but homecoming has now taken that spot for me homecoming sam raimi spiderman then far from home then spiderman then into the spiderverse,0
imo sam raimis spider man sucked,0
the trailer thing for me was always superman returns granted they pay off was not as good as spider man but sat in theatre in brando started talking black screen then kid crashed through barn and superman theme kicked in pretty sure i reacted like a kid finding out santa was real and yeah its very own its f ing superman audible moment,0
jermey looks like the john wick of youtube,0
i miss when spider man was an icon by itself not part of a thing,1
jeremy at million subs can you review the patriot mel gibson,1
there may be better spider man movies out there that have come since but they all have a certain baggage to them being part of a cinematic universe with a ton of lead up or a multiverse where it s a little intrinsic to know the original character before dabbling in the alternate takes so if anyone wants to just enjoy a spider man movie you really can t go anywhere but here and thankfully it s awesometacular,0
i can confirm the trailer was before jurassic park i remember being in the theater seeing the trailer for the first time before the movie and seeing the release date at the end of the trailer being a year away and then being depressed having to wait that long while i was stuck watching jp,0
now u have to do all the spider mans and evil dead movies lol,0
i miss the action fight scenes from this trilogy,0
i stopped watching the review to watch the trailer then came back,0
you better review asap,0
that cut to what was great,0
back to formula,0
the first sam reimi spider man movie i don t feel gets as much respect as it used to it really got the character and his world right i ve certainly gotten more appreciative of toby s performance over the years with time after seeing sony blunder their way through three versions of spider man and no i don t care how bad the costume was or how cheesy his dialogue was willem defoe absolutely killed it as the green goblin goblin is the joker to spider man s batman,0
saw this opening weekend with my buddies in high school when we were had to sit in the very front row i don t think any of us blinked once the movie started absolutely loved it,0
me when i rewatch the raimi spider man trilogy oh boy yeah,1
to me the second one is the best marvel movie ever,0
no spoilers this movie is years old it s ok to spoil it,0
the one that started it all,0
jk simmons as jj jameson is a legend,0
den of thieves need reviewing,0
sam raimis spider man may have not gotten to say it was first in the st century marvel movie coming to life because it was x men but what it did say is with a great script and director you can take any idea even as s cheezy as spider man and make it into a great big blockbuster and so opens the pandora box of everything to come,0
i was a baby when the first spider man came out grew up watching it and grew up with the other two movies being a fan of them since i could remember i watch it now and it s corny as shit but i love it anyways definitely showing this to my future kids like this is the movie that came out when i was your age enjoy,0
please review stark raving mad the one starring seann william scott from the american pie trilogy,0
i get a boner when i m scared is that considered a spider tingle am i a superhero,1
jeremy do you still believe the both sides hoax,0
jeremy looks like the guy in the elevator in spider man,1
spider man is a better movie but is iconic for so many reasons spidey spider verse spidey,1
whatttttttt you never reviewed this,0
ahaha jeremy took whole minutes to get started with the review but that story about how he found out from watching the first trailer and what a trailer is so relatable happend to me great review a lot of care affection and love for the movie and the character even though this movie had great action scenes it showed the level of commitment and professionalism they developed on how it evolved in the nd part,0
tobey is the best spider man and this is my favourite super hero movie,0
did you change the awesometacular font it looks great,1
smells like nostalgia in the comment section,1
i wish i saw that trailer in theaters as i child i would of shit my pants with joy,0
i lost my shit when spider man came out i prolly watched times that summer lol,0
i ve never liked tony maguire as spider man he starts out this meek dweeby cry baby and he never really grows from that these movies are a great spider man universe they just don t have a very good spider man,1
i d love the reeve superman films after these,1
raimi s spider man is better than the new films in almost every way far more visually impressive breathtaking action sequences memorable iconic music near perfect casting choices stories with heavy stakes heart and all colors of emotion and characters that stay true to the core of the source material,0
i like the green goblin costume,0
me and you could rule this city spiderman,0
ok now you have to do spiderman and too even the third one it still had some nice moments like sandman,1
your kinda years late,0
attempt to have jeremy review watchmen hbo series,0
this movie is like the saudi embassy in turkey bonesaw is ready in both,0
now see this is a good review not that cosmonaut shit who completely misunderstood the entire franchise,0
the picture perfect spider man movie not a perfect movie but perfect spider man let s not forget that aunt may is actually a senior citizen in a spider man movie,0
my parents watched spider man in theaters on a date i was years old and remember its and bits of watching it in theaters before i inevitably fell asleep for spider man i got the last ticket and remember the entire theater experience,0
spiderman please,0
no spoilers i like that part,1
love the story,0
spiderman really needs to be taken on its own merits and not lumped in with the other films it s a musical and if you try to judge it as a normal movie you re going to miss the whole thing,0
the goblin suit looks like a power ranger suit,0
speaking of music scores the song that i ll always associate spiderman with is hero by chad kroeger nickelback and they say that a hero will save us i m not gonna stand here and waittt,0
edit i know i m not your father then stop pretending to be love this scene to this day and it makes you really feel ben s emotions towards peter the pay off at the end with him saying i have a father his name was ben parker amazing,1
unpopular opinion i like spider man,0
i don t care what anyone says jeremy is rocking that look,1
no spoilers nvm,0
jeremy kinda looks like a younger joel from the last of us,0
i think spiderman gets a mad wrap i recommend watching the editors cut of the film add new scenes to show peter s addiction to the black suit and rearranges scenes better then the theatrical version,1
im eagerly awaiting a review of the lighthouse talk about powerhouse performance from willem dafoe,0
i ve never agreed with you more this movie is legendary,0
that teaser trailer made me excited i can t wait to watch that movie wait i have that movie,0
i bought spider man on umd at target for my psp back when psp had movies on umd it was great,0
this is nice comfort since i ve seen the nostalgia critic reviews my goodness he so cynical,0
i have so many references from this movie i use them on a daily basis it s part of my vocabulary lol,0
spider man was the trilogy s dark knight,0
jeremy is very right about the trailer it was mindblowing way back when,0
this is the exact moment i knew an awesometacular was coming it was a fun movie i nd that vote,1
i ve been waiting for you to review this for years,0
super bearded robe wearing apple juice drinking jeremy is the best jeremy,0
i don t wanna fight you flash,0
you re just getting finer as you age,0
spider man is still my all time favourite superhero movie,0
review the editors cut of spiderman,1
i ll never forget my mom letting me out early for a doctors appointment when i was in the rd grade and it was just her surprising me and taking me to see this in theaters when it was released,1
,0
love u j,0
a spiderman review please,0
this movie trilogy will forever be legendary and iconic and forever better than any other spider man movie and any negative comment against this movie is irrelevant and not true,1
saw this in the theater and was blown away by the fact that most of the action takes place in daylight which was rare,0
you had a job in damn how old are you,0
i remember when it came out in vhs and my mom bought the movie for me me and my buddy were so hyped we went straight into his room and watched it with his sister there as well then when i went back home i would watch it alone like times a day such good times with this movie as a kid,0
spiderman is in top of superhero movies,0
if jeremy runs out of ideas he could review cowboy bebop the movie,1
review jaws,0
dude looks good with a beard though my eyes have already accepted it did he ever not have a beard,1
god we re so spoiled now back then a spider man trailer was like some next level shit now we re removing uncle ben and shit because we re apparently too good for the character now,0
spiderman spiderman,0
best film spider man cant wait for,0
what about bruce campbell the amazing spiderman,0
oh man you definitely got to the the whole trilogy now,0
i died laughing at the moment,0
i see spider man i click lol,0
any chance you could review legend with tom cruise and the amazing performance from tim curry as darkness i read that movie was supposed to be r rated but changed it to pg because they thought it would make more money as a fantasy kids also mia sara is in it,0
lets not forget when tim burton almost directed a nicolas cage superman movie,0
tell me why i had a morning day dream about the day dream of this movie earlier today haha,1
omg finally someone saying out loud raimis spiderman is said to be smart but it s actually really dumb,1
hey dude review the perks of being a wallflower,0
i miss the feel of the raimi movies they get so much emotion out of me there s so many scenes where i either tear up get chills everywhere or just get a dumb smile on my face and so on i feel almost none of these things from the more recent spider man movies and it s so disappointing because i love spider man and it really sucks watching a spider man movie and feeling almost nothing i d really love to see them come back for one last time and do spider man and i know it s not likely to happen but i like to think it ll still happen someday,1
j jonah jameson robbie robertson betty brant peter parker and jeremy jahns turns out jeremy was a live action comic book character the whole time,1
review death stranding,0
i m not gonna cut my hair till jeremy cuts his hair,1
i love the whole look bruh don t let them tell u different,0
imagine willem dafoe as the grinch,1
can t wait for spider man review still the best superhero movie,0
jeremy is about to start working again,0
spiderman was the first movie i saw in theaters i was years old it blew me away it will always have a special place in my heart thank you sam raimi,0
jeremy jahn s lookin like john wick,0
i m no raimi purist or anything but you re damn right it s awesometacular,1
spider man is arguably the greatest comic book movie ever made,1
loving the beard gettin kratos levels of epic,0
is it just me or is jeremy looking more and more like john wick with a longer beard,1
one thing misses from that movie that broke it for me the spiderman who jokes in any occasion as spiderman in that movie peter was crying more than a widow and always had a sadness in his face any other aspect of the movie was great for that time i agree with jeremy,0
top marvel movies logan spider man endgame days of future past spider man civil war guardians of the galaxy winter soldier iron man x men first class deadpool infinity war the avengers spider verse black panther homecoming x men thor ragnork first avenger deadpool big hero far from home planet hulk,0
every kid thought they could shoot webs if they were to get bitten by any random spider including myself,0
but movies don t change lol,0
spider man getting his ass beat by green goblin in the end was intense compare this to the cornball films we have today lol,0
you should review the machinist,0
i still like this trilogy more than any spider man film since i was really excited for the mcu to make the perfect spider man movie but looking back homecoming and ffhome aren t as spider many as these movies strangely cause mcu s been really embracing the comic bookyness of these characters i kind of wonder if sony s tie kind of won t let mcu fully spread it s wings with spidey even though they ironically made these movies,0
i feel old for jeremy i wasn t even a fetus in,0
raimi and spectacular jj are my favourites,0
awww what is he shy if we can get a picture of julia roberts in a thong we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo,1
jeremy man not gonna lie this review almost got me a little teary eyed loved every second of it,0
can you make a video on the watchmen movie dc,0
jeremy please review superman final cut,0
to be fair have j k simmons or willem dafoe ever been bad in anyting they ve been in,1
spiderman could ve been greatness but,0
review donnie darko please,0
so perfect he can t be recast,0
my favourite marvel film of all time is years old like me this year,0
this was my first pg movie when i was about,0
the first raimi movies will always be head a shoulders above all other spiderman movies because they just fully understood how the comic book genre was also how did raimi get away with all the nazi imagery and undertones,0
the trilogy that shaped my childhood i grew up on these movies man i still wonder how would ve turned out with the vulture maybe in another timeline,1
spiderman was still better than a lot of comic book films people just hate it cos hating it has become popular i said what i said,0
yeeeeessss more longer reviews like this also drink your apple juice forget the haters lol,0
never clicked on a vid faster,0
christopher nolan if we can get the audience to not care whether he is in the costume or not we will have won i think the same applies here,1
no one has beaten this origin story n no one has beaten this scene with great power comes great responsibility,1
i love this film i love jeremy this is all i want,0
still one of my favorite superhero movies,0
please review return of the joker it s a hidden gem to many superhero fans,0

it would be cool to have videos of stories from your movie theater projectionist job,0
one of the reasons i like rami s interpretation of spider man is the themes he adds to the movies spider man responsibility spider man choice spider man forgiveness,0
jeremy is slowly turning into joel,0
we are still living in the aftermath of sony s meddling with spider man and then denying sam raimi a th film,0
jeremy i want an in depth analysis of spiderman what went wrong what went right you also didnt mention ted raimi who plays jjs brother,0

i still love spiderman it had plenty of flaws but because they did the extensive leg work in the first two movies i feel like they made a movie that was still worth watching just to see the end of all the characters,0
please review return of the joker it s a hidden gem to many superhero fans,0

watch the editors cut of spider man,0
please review return of the joker it s a hidden gem to many superhero fans,0
hey jeremy you should watch spider man it has some alternative scenes and i like it a little more than the original cut tbh love your videos greetings from argentina,0
please review return of the joker it s a hidden gem to many superhero fans,0
tobey is the best spider man ever,1
lol jk simons was so good he even no spoilers,0
while a classic and a fun watch this is probably my least favorite spider man film,0
guys it s now can we finally admit that spider man is actually pretty great,1
yes and the uncle ben from this movie i would become a superhero if he was my uncle and someone gunned him down also damn good scene,0
i remember seeing the movie in theatres with my dad and older brother and it s still one of my favourite movies also you look great with a beard jeremy,0
maybe you shouldn t get window curtain moustache as an addition to your beard,0
does anybody want pizza,0
just finished watching today dusted off the old dvd collection lol,0
i was commenting,0
i miss those surprise s i miss nagging my mom every morning to go see super hero movies i miss no responsibilities no bills i just miss those years,0
raimi s spider man is my favorite version of spidey as a character he s the acrobatic bent limbed web slinger that we just didn t seem to get afterward if that even makes sense to anyone but me,1
i haven t seen this channel in a while so it surprised me when i saw he had longer hair and a bushy beard,1
the way goblin says spiderman is amazing,0
i was a projectionist back then too i have that two towers trailer on mm at home,0
hell yeah but i probably played the game more than watching the movie lol,0
anyone else loves hearing jeremy talking about this movie,1
dude you look awesome don t sweat it,0
sam raimis spider man fight with green goblin is just so damn awesome,0
jeremy looks like he should be driving a cab in the east village,0
power pill,0
yes its freaking timeless,0
i really hope when jeremy gets to he doesn t give into the internet may not be perfect but there is legitimately amazing stuff in it people make it seem much worse than it actually is,1
please play yakuza,0
ain t that despite everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you just the truth green goblin predicted the cancel culture for real,1
my main turn off with raimi s spiderman was the trope of every teenager in the movie looks like an undercover cop,0
please review return of the joker it s a hidden gem to many superhero fans,0
this video made me happy brought back so many amazing childhood memories and not just a year old me watching this movie on the big screen for the first time simpler fun times,0
willem dafoe is my favorite part of this entire movie,0
i remember when i saw the twin towers trailer and i was like,0
finallyyyy,0
raimi s spiderman was great even in its cheesy parts shame that spiderman is dogsh t in movies nowadays,1
anyone else miss seeing a beardless jeremy,0
dude youre giving me mad nostalgia from the good ol projectionist days,1
always refreshing and satisfying to see someone singing this movie s praises despite some of the imperfections it has there have been other great comic book movies that hollywood has given us but as for this movie not only is it my favorite in the genre but it s also my all time favorite movie and i feel the exact same way about the fantastic sequel that followed afterwards and i highly doubt we ll ever get to see a superhero movie as unique charming genuine and wholesome like spider man ever again and i don t care what anybody else says but as far as i m concerned tobey maguire is the best peter parker spider man we ve ever had i will defend him to my grave and even when i get heaven,1
agh this just brought me back memories to being a kid and jumping from couch to couch pretending to be spider man web swinging from building to building,0
when the first one came out i saw it every single day for days straight it was such an amazing experience,1
you are turning into rasputin more like jasputin,0
spider man are a masterpiece,0
i kinda feel like these movies are really outdated,0
finally,1
i dig the green goblin mask,0
love these movies but always have a sour taste in my mouth because i was when spiderman came out and it was the first time i ever remember being actually disappointed by a movie like usually that young i just loved everything regardless so this has always haunted me lmfaooo,0
loving these throwbacks and your stories,0
can you redo the the dark knight review,0
imo sam raimi is the reason why we have the types of comic book movies we have today he started it and set the benchmark for the mcu and to a lesser extent the dc movies,0
didn t need this review today i already know how great this movie is but seeing jeremys excitement about spider man makes me want to rewatch the trilogy,0
goblin wake up little spider wake up you re not dead just paralyzed temporarily you re an amazing creature spider man you and i are not so different spider man i m not like you you re a murderer goblin well to each his own i chose my path you chose the way of the hero and they found you amusing for a while the people of this city but the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail fall die trying inspite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you why bother spider man because it s right goblin here s the real truth there are million people in this city and those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders you me we re exceptional goblin i could squash you like a bug right now but i m offering you a choice join me imagine what we could accomplish together what we could create or we could destroy case the death of countless innocents in selfish battle again and again and again until we re both dead is that what you want think about it hero,1
my favourite romantic movie,0
your last video was the best,0
with so many old movies why don t you also review watchmen,1
hear me out spider man isn t bad not a chance it s a great film don t me,1
i love the score at the point in the movie after he beats up flash and runs to that alley way to discover his spider powers when it starts playing while he crawls up the wall awesomeness,0
spiderman plz,0
i remember finding out about the movie through a picture on the newspaper and i was like mom mom we gotta see this,0
awesometacular,1
i love this movie they nailed james jonah jameson perfect casting my favorite part was that he was a good person he was willing to protect others even when he could have died this movie still holds up,0
j k simmons is amazing the only thing that came close to him in these movies was his role in red alert as the american president he is just a great guy for those kind of roles,1
jeremy you cool man ya your cool got a lil further i was when this came out blew my mind loved this movie,0
sam raimis spider man is the only one for me the others are pure crap spider man is a masterpiece,0
time change people change spiderman doesn t change,0
the day has come,0
review death stranding,0
please review peanut butter falcon,1
i take it i m the only one that doesn t hate i watched it not too long ago and it reminded me of iron man just how many plot threads are flying around at once love jk simmons in this btw,0
this is the best spider man movie for me easily,1
i was turning the weekend after it came out it didn t hit s tas spiderman trash talk i agree with everything else you said but i will say spiderman is still the best spiderman movie,0
okay so now day one of trying to get him to review the masterpiece that is spider man,0
is that john wick,0
dont lie that scene where hes on the ceiling with a cut and hes trying to avoid gg human form norman you were on the edge of your seat,1
if you watch spider man watch the editors cut,0
review rdr jeremy cmonnnn,0
damn dude you re a good storyteller vids like this are why i m a fan of the channe,1
being a spiderman fan or a geek nerd isn t the reason most dudes don t get girls in high school it s mostly because they lack the self confidence and doesn t put a lot of effort in their looks and hygiene i know it was ust a joke though,0
fun fact the girl with the green sweater on the bus at the beginning of the movie is liz allen,0
this movie holds a place near to my heart my family didnt have much growing up so birthdays where a small toy and a meal we didnt have the money to do more i was and saw the ad on tv for this movie called spiderman coming out near my birthday and i just thought i really want to see that i went around the neighborhood collecting cans and doing chores to find money for the movie on the day of my birthday i said i d go to a friends house and went to the theater with a pocketful of change i didn t know how money worked so i just dropped it all on the counter and said i want to see spiderman the guy at the booth helped me out by counting my coins helped me with the menu and brought me to the auditorium and there i was with my small popcorn and my medium coke enjoying the birthday gift i had worked so hard for i didn t really understand the plot i was scared shitless during norman s transformation to the point that i had nightmares and thats how my parents found out but i was so happy i fell in love with cinema at that moment i can t hear the opening theme without tearing up a bit it brings back the feeling that i could do everything and that i would work my way to my goals it s my most cherished cinema going experience and to this day that is still how i celebrate my birthday i have no party for myself no gifts my gf and mother always plan something now and get me a little something but i still go to the cinema and with the spare change i got through the year i buy myself a ticket a popcorn and a coke and feel invincible thank you jeremy for reviewing this your videos mean so much to me they helped me think about the world in a different way in a time i needed it they even lead into meeting my said girlfriend but thats a story for another time thank you for your time and effort i will keep watching everything you make,1
jason bourne that s jesus christ,1
all these movies are great yes all,0
the sam raimi spider man trilogy is heavily flawed in many aspects but god damn do i love all of the raimi movies flaws and all theyre cheesy dumb and enjoyable in almost every aspect which is more than i can say for the awfully dull amazing spider man movies,0
i hope he does a good job of doctor strange sometimes marvel and great directors don t mix but when they do it s well magic,0
crazy i just watched this yesterday with my son,0
if you watch watch the director s cut,0
spider man will always get the bad end of the stick because it followed up two great spider man movies but in my opinion the amazing spider man is just way worse,0
original how to train your dragon,0
there s no title card no intro music,0
i ll never forget seeing this movie when i was and almost shitting my pants this was such an intense spiderman movie compared to what children are getting now,0
hi jeremy can you review avatar the last airbender series i know you did a review on that dumpster fire movie years ago mentioned you haven t seen the show back then i will love to hear your opinion on it i know it s trending now also but it s one of my favorite shows for years and it will fit with the new appreciation for the show,0
i was a little kid when this movie came out and it was spectacular i got so wrapped up in spiderman i remember going to see this movie three times in theaters,0
review red dead you have reviewed fhe st one might as well review and play the witcher please its flippen amazing i just got it,1
this movie really hit home for me as a high school kid at the time i always felt like the nerdy kid and it gave me the courage to talk to my crush for the first time the way peter did with mj,0
spiderman and are so much better than the new spiderman and but somehow people think spiderman homecoming is really good even the best mcu movie what,0
one gripe i have with the green goblin aside from the suit is his motivation it wasn t really a problem back then but now that we have complex villains with complex motivations it s something i noticed norman s motivation was to wipe out everyone who stood in the way of him and his company because they wanted to kick him out of his own company at first but after his first fight with spider man there really is no reason for norman to be the goblin again he had already succeeded in his goal before spidey showed up he killed all the board members and norman osborn is now the only person in charge of oscorp he now has all the power he wanted he could ve been on his merry way and peter would have no clue what his intentions were peter doesn t actively investigate for the goblin and doesn t even suspect norman is behind all of this so everything goblin does from that point forward was just because they needed spider man to fight a big villain,0
review red dead,1
oh jeremy is going to need more tequila after seeing spider man if you thought powers was horrible wait until you see spider man you ll be drunk all night and crying in the corner,0
although spider man never grows spiderwebs out his wrists i was that kid that knew that and still used glue on my wrist to stick to stuff,0
man that teaser trailer blew my mind when it came out it was attached to final fantasy spirit within here in the uk when it started we thought it was a nokia ad but at some point while the helicopter was flying i turned to my friend and was like oh man this is spider man when i got home all i spoke to my dad about was that teaser and he asked me was the film good and i said nah it sucks but that trailer then the next morning the trailer was on the tv and i called him to come and watch it,0
hey jeremy i d like to suggest reviewing one cut of the dead i think that you d really enjoy this movie keep up the good reviews my friend,0
i didn t read spider man comics till after i saw this movie then i read the comics and i didn t like it why doesn t he have webshooters why does green goblin look like a power ranger villian why don t i care about mj why do the stunts look rehearsed where is the spider man from the comics these are thoughts i had after watching it every single time afterwards then andrew garfield and tom holland had thier turn and i was like maybe you lead with that next time lazy inaccurate nostalgia porn that is the raimi trilogy,0
children of men plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,1
i think the first are perfect superhero movies and though the third is weak i still like it,0
jeremy when ur beard gets long enough plz braid it like thor in endgame,0
jeremy you re starting to look like the wolverine,1
what s missing for me in the current spider man movies is the heart the raimi films had a lot of heart and i think is what elevated them considerably among the rest mcu spidey gets a lot of credit for being the spider man that finally joins the avengers which you know whoa spider man in the avengers cool not a snarky comment btw but i think the novelty of it wears off sam raimi didn t have any of that or in fact didn t really need any of it to sell spider man instead he added a lot of impact and weight to his stories say what you will about spider man but it gave us life lessons on forgiveness and revenge and put a lot of impact into harry s death which is honestly more than i can say for the end of endgame and to me that says a lot about the storytelling of both franchises one succeeds by having multiple superheroes on screen while the other succeeded by telling a compelling story which really showed the burdens that came with being a superhero and that to me is what audiences will look back more on not from being on screen with other large established characters not from having mindblowing set pieces but from having a lot of heart which is something i think comic book movies could really take a page from and the sam raimi trilogy really had a lot of it,0
don t ever shit on spiderman its a great film,0
u should review a scanner darkly a weird keanu reeves movie featuring woody harldson and iron man i mean robert downey jr its animated too,0
oh i can t wait for jeremy to get to spider man,0
bonesaw is readyyyy,0
william defoe still is the best spider man villain no contest,0
i remember going to see this discreetly on my own back in as a year old teenager different times before he was as cool as he is now always loved the spiderman cartoon as a kid and came out of the cinema completely blown away too bad i couldn t tell my mates at the time watched it again recently on k uhd and loved it,1
man the fact that footage used to be filmed specifically for a trailer is kinda wild to me cause it s definitely not as common as it used to be,0
tobey will always be my spiderman and there are only great spiderman movies with him in it,1
so you read comments eh then watch the korean gem the host i think you might like it,0
i wanted you to review them but never commented you still somehow heard it made a review if that doesn t prove the telepathic love between us jeremy i don t know what will,0
honestly spider man is just a classic that gets better and better with each viewing i can never not have a good time watching it that s not to say the first aren t good films they are timeless classics and i will agree that is fantastic,0
this blew my mind as a kid i was already a big spidey fanboy prior but when they said they were gonna make a live action film my mind broke lol man i was flipping out back then,0
you always make my day better love you jeremy,0
i ll finish your sentence so perfect that he is that character even more ill say from the show,0
love the review but honestly spider man review is the one i m looking forward too the most lol,1
jeremy mentions this moment but its a gem in the movie at the site of the burning building the officers approach in a hurry hold it right there we re taking you in upon hearing a woman screaming without hesitation peter turns to the man who would have arrested him and tell him i m going without much more than a second thought he s ready to put his life on the line in service of others similar to what good cops to and you have to imagine the police officer knew that as well the cop needed a moment to think i ll be here when you get back clearly a man following his orders and doing what he s told to preserve the law i m not coming back chief gotta love tobey s witty remark while also staying true to his heroic ideals i used to interpret this as peter didn t know what d happen if he went back inside that burning building and there s a chance he might go in there and never come out clearly the cop knew in his heart that his duty was to people and running out of time he has to make a decision but quickly tells peter go go peter lifts himself into the air before catapulting himself into the flaming window the small moments of genuine heroism something inspirational and gives you faith in people that s what its all about man,1
best spiderman movies as well just not even a contest can t stand the new stuff the mcu spiderman is horrid it s like a caricature of spiderman doesn t understand the character what so ever and has some of the worst spiderman wiriting i ve ever seen took away every single nuance of his character,0
i grew up on the sam raimi spider man movies,0
i believe jeremy was going to say spoilers so perfect that he was brought into the mcu as jameson,1
if you took a freeze frame from your last vids it would look like your turning into the wolf man,0
this film had a big influence on my channel,0
im a huge spiderman fan but was never a superfan of this trilogy i always thought they were ok was bad lol but i see as overrated,1
this means we get a spiderman review noice,0
oh the nostalgia when someone talks about tobey maguire spiderman trilogy,1
you know in the sam rami spider man trilogy he always had the oldsmobile delta from the evil dead movies and bruce campbell had cameos in all movies even the narrator of spider man the game,0
i am so happy to see this video uploaded,0
green goblin dr octopus and sandman in these films are some of the best villains ever in comic book films these films meant so much to me as a kid and i m so happy that they still hold up as good films bring in the reviews of the other also isn t that bad it s easily among the worst spider man films but sandman is so good in it that i can forgive it for a lot of its flaws,0
well now you gotta do spider man,0
i actually preferred organic webs over web shooters now it seems like the web shooters is just an excuse to make him have a ton of gadgets they can sell toys of back then it felt like this oridinary dude actually got spider powers and not just super strength there was some body horror involved as well like the hairs on his fingers or the web slits on his wrists i like that i love whenever superheroes have some mild gruesome stuff happening to them because of the powers you don t see it that much anymore and it kinda disappoints me,0
as a kid adopted by lower income grandparents in the early s even though peter is adopted by his aunt this movie just felt like a movie for me especially as a young child and i just think it s a underrated aspect of the film aunt may and uncle ben they just felt like a real elderly couple raising a teenager,0
spider man is the best because of how cheesy it is it s a full on meme movie,0
they did film the movie with the webshooters on him and then painted over them on post oll at some scenes you can see his wrists and more shadowed the other parts of his body and some promo images of the film had the web shooters,0
thank you so much,0
i know exactly what you were going to say,0
we need the whole trilogy reviewed now jeremy,1
i cannot wait for sm review,0
i was in and my family was visiting my cousins in germany in the winter so there i was playing with some action figures on the floor when i look up at the tv and i see a second ad of spider man swinging into his room and taking his mask off i just stood there my little mind blown as some random german commercials continued to play as soon as i went back to my home country i told all my friends about it and nobody believed me until the next year d god i probably saw it times in the cinema so yeah jeremy i totally get what you mean about that movie magic before social media,0
the only disservice this movie does is putting a power rangers villain mask on william defoe the dude has a perfect green goblin grin and they cover his face up love j k simmons as j j he was perfect was happy to hear him cameo in the spiderman ps game,0
gosh that revenge scene,0
jk simmons is the greatest casting of a comic book charter of all time he s so good they put him in two universes,1
watching jeremy kahn s spiderman reveiw before playing marvel spiderman it s a spiderman kinda day,0
can we have more of these longer cut reviews i d take a minute video honestly good stuff,1
my only flaw with this film is the chemistry between tobey maguire and kirsten dunst i found it cringe inducing and unwatchable but that s just me you re more than welcome to disagree,0
speaking of comments have you started transformers prime yet,0
this movie was such a phenomenon i remember me and everyone i knew loving it so much i know upon rewatch they re not the best movies in the world but as a young spider man fan this movie was everything to me i feel like a kid again every time i watch it i was like i think when it came out,1
today marked exactly weeks from when i was supposed to go back to school and at today my school sent out an email saying we will be remote through the end of fall it was one of the most depressing pieces of news i ve heard since being sent home in the spring after a few hours of being miserable i go on you tube and i see jeremy s review for the original spider man jeremy this review put the biggest smile on my face on one of the saddest days i couldn t help but smile when you were talking about the teaser trailer and how spiderman should have shot webs out of his ass thank you for always being able to put a smile on my face jeremy you are a true hero,0
the game is amazing also spiderman on xbox ps gamecube but is also remember for not a good year,0
that movie still a masterpiece,0
awesome movie should reviewed it years ago,0
plz shave you look homeless,0
just watched the terminator and i d really appreciate it if you were to do a review on it jeremy,0
i literally just watched this movie two days ago rewatching it made me realize i broke up with a girl with the exact line toby mcguire used at the end of the movie when i was in high school like an asshole,0
review the blade trilogy,0
i have been waiting for this day for a long time kylo ren,0
i ve never seen any of the other non tobey maguire spider man movies,1
jeremy if you do go back to watch spider man properly make shore you see the editor s cut,1
i was literally thinking two hours ago how the raimi series still holds up decades later and was gonna boot up spiderman ps after i finish ghost of tsushima lmao then you show up with a spiderman review god s got a sense of humor,1
spider man awesometacular spider man awesometacular spider man a good time no alcohol required,1
i never saw any teaser or trailer for this until i saw the movie and i loved it it marked me that first time i saw that final fight i was so scared and so amazed by danny elfman s score and that final swing this movie its sequel and even the third the entire trilogy will be forever epic,0
sorry jeremy i love your reviews love your energy but i had to stop the video to watch this teaser and then come back to the review i hadn t seen the teaser in nearly years so this was a gnarly can of delicious nostalgia that i just had to pop open fun story for me after sony pictures had to recall the videotapes they had pressed for the home video release of a knight s tale to remove the twin towers teaser somehow my neighborhood hollywood video never sent their knight s tale tapes back as the release was scheduled for the week following and i bought one of those used tapes with the teaser on it it s lowkey one of my most prized possessions,0
i like it more than the nd one because of that darn scene with him being unmasked on the subway if that scene didn t happen spider man might be my goat but this movie takes that prize pretty handily,1
is it normal to cry while watching a movie review thank you jeremy this one took me back peace brother,0
wait what were you talking about with the no spoilers thing shit don t do that man if you re not gonna bring up a point because of spoilers don t acknowledge you have the point to begin with now i m curious and i desperately wanna know what you were talking about,0
jeremy looks like joel from the last of us,0
i watched this as a kid plenty of times nostalgic fun and funny,0
your last video was amazing don t apologize,0
the one thing nobody talks about is how amazing and brutal the fight scenes are the final battle in spiderman scared me as a kid insanely brutal the train scene in spiderman is the greatest action set piece of all time and even the subway scene in spiderman is really really good,1
jeremy looks pretty badass with a beard and longer hair,0
looking forward to spider man,0
where s the bioshock infinite spoiler review,0
we all know,1
jeremy looks like he just got done filming the fourth john wick,1
cut your hair man you look like a cave man,0

jeremy review avatar the last airbender it s the star wars of my generation except with better writing and characters,0
i ll be i like the green goblin costume in the version compare to the one that they allegedly were going to use,1

i disagree it s more than awesometacular,0
what are the odds of him not wearing any pants,0
do my eyes deceive me a youtuber who actually understands and appreciates the camp of sam raimi it can t be looking forward to your review of spider man aka the best comic book movie ever made,1
hilarious,0
mary jane is such a bad person,0
that goblin quote perfectly describes cancel culture today,0

k now avatar the last airbender,0
after the spider man movies please review the first transformers movie after all the second one did bring you to start your channel but you ve never talked about the first transformers movie,0

i can t wait for the spider man review,0
spida man spida man does whateva a spida can shoots a web in his girl guess what s up now head on curve look out here comes the spida man,0

review deathstroke knights vs dragons,0
this was my first superhero movie i saw in theaters when i was,0
legitimately my favorite superhero film and one if my favorite films period eat your heart out holland,1
why is jeremy looking like wolverine,0
i hope jeremy enjoys sm more on the rewatch yes it has flaws yes its the worst of the but i think it get more crap than it deserves,0
spider man is weirdly my favorite i could try to hide myself but honestly i ve don t even remember how many times i rewatched it so then i d be lying heavy out of all the jokes about it it was made fun of so much to the point the bad things werent bad anymore it was just funny things now then i enjoyed it more i don t watch it as seriously like i did before but with a chill and watch and laugh kinda thing but with moments were i still took it seriously,0
does anyone else think jeremy looks like dimitri form spiderman far from home,1
a video that is actually longer than minutes cool,0
all the goofiness just excels the movie experience for me in these movies d,0
for me toby great peter parker eh spider man garfield great spiderman eh peter parker holland great at both,0
my beard is catching up to jeremy s but i ll never have that sexy hair,0
review the movie palm springs on hulu for the love of god dont read what s it s about just watch it jk simmons and andy sandberg are in it,0
sam raimi s spidey and are hands down my favorite spidey movies i wish the studio hadn t messed up spidey,0
spiderman review next,0
please review the lighthouse i really wanna see your thoughts on it,0
spider man was disappointing back in the day but i think it s aged well we ve gotten so many mediocre to outright bad comic book movies since then that s s low points which seemed bad in are easier to swallow i hope you ll be pleasantly surprised when you get to it,0
you should review spree,0
hey jeremy idk if you ever reply to comments but i was wondering if you still are disappointed in stranger things season,0
they made this j jonah jamison absolutely perfect for all movies i remember in spiderman the animated series jamison hated spiderman cause he wore a mask so he thought he was a criminal that s the vibe i get from him in these movies,0
did you see the alternate green goblin suit i thought it looked amazing,0
for the love of fucking god if you don t do original spider man after this i m gonna lose my shit,0
best origin movie ever,0
i can t get enough of the spider man vs green goblin fights in this movie also the scene when osborn turns into the goblin scared the crap out of me as a kid,1
you should review the original american the grudge,0
keep these older types of reviews coming please,0
spider man is better than you remember i was in the same boat before i rewatched it and it holds up better to me at least than i had remembered it,0
so he s finally reviewing sam raimi spiderman it s definitely pizza time,1
jahns you re fired now get to work,0
can u do a spoiler review for hannibal,0
the best spider man movies in my opinion not just because they came out when i was a kid but they really are just way more entertaining to me than any of the modern spider man films,0
kirsten dunst s mj is so unlikable,0
i remember when spiderman was the thing back in the early s,1
i d say spider man is better than spider man but after the origin it kinda gets boring still good but pretty boring ngl,0
me sees jeremy has started reviewing the raimi spiderman movies oh boy yeah,1
after he talked about spiderman should have shot the webs out of his ass i thought the next words out of his mouth were gonna be i was bummed out that spider man didn t shoot webs out of his ass,0
one of the best movies of it s time growing up a spiderman fan this movie was astonishing when it came out even with it s bumps and warts,0
my favourite spider man movie,0
i remember seeing spider man in theaters and i absolutely loved it i was a huge comic book fan and i agree whatever small changes they made i could over look because the film was so good and fun a comic book movie should be fun and i had a blast,0
been loving your gaming reviews hope you do more,0
this movie came out days after i was born and it is my favorite movie,0
i personally believe that the tasm spidey theme is the most iconic,0
hello from vietnam,0
sam raimi s spider man and tobey maguire s portrayal was and is the best ever,1
what was he gonna spoil at,0
don t forget the action this wasn t flashy punches and family friendly fights tobey took some punishment in those films and that final fight was with gg was brutal and you felt all those hits i love action movies where the hero is visually beaten up and barely hanging in there in end it shows that they went through hell and really earned that victory,0
sam raimi s spider man is always an iconic classic,0
pizza time,0
spider man were raimi s vision spider man was the result of studio involvement,0
can we all agree sam raimi s spidey suit was the best on screen suit we have ever seen it s like perfect,0
really wanna see jeremy review under the red hood movie,0
i was a kid and until watching this movie i had never heard of spider man or any other superhero after watching it i went nuts and kept drawing spider man all the time i had never seen a comic book i loved the first spider man movie and for a while i kept putting random spiders on my hands with hope of them biting me and giving me powers,1
hey man spider man sucks it s flawed but it s got some fantastic moments everything sandman except the retcon the black suit the fight with harry in the beginning some parts with gwen stacy might be biased cuz i love bryce dallas howard honestly as flawed as this movie is it s a guilty pleasure of mine spider man is amazing and is a damn masterpiece,0
hell yeah jermey i m glad you did this review this is the og spiderman keep the old school marvel thing going i d love to see you review blade with wesley snipes,0
give the third movie a watch again it s flawed no question but it s still a good film eddie brock as a scumbag version of peter parker who literally shirks off responsibility at every turn is a good example of sam raimi doing what he does best with these films and emphasize the villains as dark reflections of the the hero with norman it was blind ambition with otto it was hyper fixation both of these demons were manifested into actual totems in the form of osborn s goblin persona and the tentacles taking over octavius s higher brain function you can actually see the transition as the light on them changes color with eddie it s all about his inability to actually own up to his own faults he never actively dates gwen outside of a single coffee meet up but can t take a hint he rightfully gets fired for faking pictures for the bugle but literally prays for god to striker peter parker dead i think the flaws come from venom having to be wrapped up entirely in a single film rather than being set up in and then becoming a looming antagonist in but raimi did as best he could with the studio interfering as much as they did,0
watchmen and indiana jones triology next please,0
jeremy looks like a caveman,0
one of the most meme movies ever i still love it,0
best quarantine beard award,0
i panicked for a second when i didn t hear the intro music,0
spiderman tho,0
i was when this movie came out spidey was my favorite marvel hero i grew up with both x men and spider man the animated series but i always thought toby was the perfect peter parker but was missing something as spider man,0
are you ok do you need help if you do just plink,0
i know this is an awful movie but i d love to hear you shit on the crow city of angels i like it but i need your opinion lok,0
no matter what i do no matter how hard i try the ones i love will always be the ones who pay spider man spider man is my favorite comic book movie of all time and one of my favorite films of all time and i dont care what anyone says tobey maguire will always be the best spidey,1
the movie that made me fall in love with superheroes,0
turning into the wolfman,0
there s just a certain wholesomeness to the old spider man movies that i just love those big ass american flags that show up in key scenes spider man s unwavering goodness etc you look back at the old raimi movies now that we ve got the deconstructionist superhero movies like bvs and joker and it s like looking back in time they re just such an integral part of my childhood i ll always love them,1
willem dafoe owned that norman osborne role,0
has jeremy completed his transition to jesus yet,1
lol i liked the new look king shit,0
attempt to get jeremy to review sam raimi s spider man we finally got em,0
he has so much hair he s blending into his jacket he s soon going to be a black void with a red background,0
review slither,1
and stay cool jaremy john,0
god damnit power pill,0
spide man isn t that bad that s right i said it,1
now i better see spiderman movie and game review both were godlike,0
this was the first movie where i first saw willem dafoe in still plays a great green goblin,1
tobey is the best spider man,0
i let my kids watched this and they loved it,0
literally the best spider man period,0
and the legend of korra on netflix its is amazing,0
this movie was one of the most important moments of my childhood,0
please review the indiana jones movies jeremy,0
do spider man and,0
thank you jeremy for this review ready for spider man why you ask because it s was amazing,1
review the last samurai and troy,0
that was exactly me today with the amazing spider man turned it off after minutes just can t get through it wait no rating it s spidertacular,0
this is my first introduction to superhero movies my very first one,0
jeremy like years late for the review of this film also jeremy i missed the part where that s my problem,0
review the deer hunter,0
i practically had goosebumps after watching the sam raimi spider man film and especially when i listened to the films brilliant music soundtrack in my car,0
so if we are doing old marvel movies then blade pls,0
if you re going to do spider man soon ish could you also review the best spider man game ever the movie tie in if you can get a ps and a copy of the game,0
sam raimi is the guy kevkn feige aspires to be,1
sam raimi spiderman is the best i actually miss the seriosu spiderman now every superhero movie feels a need to be comedic,1
the raimi films were proper spider man movies unlike the mcu ones which were nothing more than spider iron boy with web shooters stark and parker were best friends and respected one another not once did parker see stark as a father figure lmao wtf the mcu spider man movies are some of the worst depictions of the character,0
i love peter parker spiderman the way sam raimi made it i also like old comics and the s animated series of spiderman however i do not even care to watch the amazing spiderman movies or the disney spiderman i just do not want to watch those it feels like a waste when this trilogy did everything the way i like it old spiderman games are nice but also the newest ps title but the story was not so great why do we need copy cat moralis anyway,0
dreams do come true jeremy finally reviewed raimi spider man can you do friends next,0
the mcu spider man doesn t hold a candle to the raimi trilogy the original movies were cheese sure but they also had interesting characters drama and heart so yeah take notes mcu,1
this movie is very personal i used to read spiderman comics and used to watch the animated series and i didn t know there were live action superhero movies then i saw this this is the first english movie i saw too,0
could you review that abysmal days movie on netflix because i love you and we always hurt the ones we love,0
you need to review tucker and dale vs evil,0
youtube unsubscribed from your channel but it still gave me the notification i subbed again but damn i hate youtube,0
hay jeremy have you ever thought of reviewing the tv show elementary with johnny miller and lucy lui,0
i rewatched this and the second movie so many times for me is just the best spiderman ever nothing wrong with garfield or holland but i never can watch their movies more than once the new ones are so flat empty,0
jeremy sort of looks like the unknown son of john wick or what do you guys think,0
oh fuck yeah i never knew i needed something till it was given to me,0
not one mention of bone saw mcgraw,0
i ve always liked green goblin s suit in this movie,1
i don t think this movie aged very well,1
few more months and jeremys hair will be long enough to look like a wizard,0
everyone hates on but you can see their are some jems between characters you can see sam reimi plan but producers kept fucking with him,0
this has always been my definitive spider man because it stays true to his character right down to the campy acting and cheesy one liners holland and garfield were alright as the webhead but in my opinion maguire is the best live action spider man,1
after sam raimi nobody else put classic quotes from the comic books the rest of the movies are just pop trash filled with action scenes i quit watching after his trilogy,1
the holy trilogy of second parts xmen spiderman and the dark knight,1
next time parker brilliant but lazy,0
you gotta review spider man and now,0
og spider man better than mcu spider man,0
sorry but elfman s spider man score was boring and lackluster and as generic as it gets just like his terrible justice league score,0
this is my second favorite spider man movie and the spider man that i grew up with watching it on dvd,0
was this the last comic book style superhero film before they had to do the whole realistic gritty style were all sick of,0
i know people have a problem with the green goblin suit but compared to how dated the cgi is in this movie i m pretty sure that most people can live with the suit,0
jeez are you going to keep growing your beard until there s a covid vaccine,0
jeremy watch spider man and,0
let it happen it ll happen,0
it was a great movie the green goblin costume messed it up for me,0
spider man are absolute perfection i would much rather re watch spider man over any of the boring ass andrew garfield or tom holland movies,0
saw that trailer it was awesome i was at the time,0
the reason why part didn t work was there was too many cooks in the kitchen it was no longer just rami s film like the first two i like the rd as a guilty pleasure but its awful and the other two are amazing,0
this movie is wat spiderman is all about mcu is butchering the character for cheap ass jokes and iron man fan boy ing like ya sure mcu spidy movies are fun but they don t have the spidy spirit in them,1
the spider man trailer you re referring to was first released with the final fantasy film it s the only reason i went to see that film if you see this post jeremy please review the film the trip from it s british humor at it s best it stars steve cohan you won t regret it,0
we need to have a review of spiderman that movie to me is one of the best comic movies ever made,1
i m gonna get blasted for this but i always thought it was overrated it got a big meh from me when i saw it everyone around me was raving about it and i couldn t see what they saw in it,0
did i hear that correctly jeremy didn t like spider man very much,0
umbrella academy please,0
i love that jeremy is reviewing some of the older movies with the lack of new releases it made me rewatch some movies that i haven t seen for a long time,0
spider man review next please,0
minutes yaaaaaaaaaaaay let s goooo,0
spider man is still good just feel like people hated it for no reason how can a dance scene ruin a movie for someone after loving the first movies,1
this is one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen,1
i never had any problem with the way cg spider man moved because no human can move the way spidey does it s not humanly possible,0
spidey compared the the holland and garfield movies is a goddamn masterpiece filled to the brim with imagination,0
this pandemic has brought us two very special things from this channel jeremy bringing back his retro reviews and caveman jeremy,0
silvio what are you doing reviewing movies on youtube the feds have a warrant out for your arrest,0
ahh i remember a time without social media i remember not having a clue that jurassic park was coming out and i saw a trailer when i went to see the mummy returns and my mind was blown that will literally never happen again,0
this was the first movie i ever saw in theaters,0
i thought you hated these movies for being too corny or cheesy,0
spider man and spider man are the best spider man movies,0
it s not even about nostalgia if i m being honest the sam raimi movies felt like actual films not visionless rehashes of an already working mass appeal formula applied to a brand this of course being the holland movies,1
the new spider man is good but you will never beat the sam raimi and toby maguire movies,1
we are who we choose to be,0
you got me with the intro song xd,0
now that you came back to a movie you love let s go back to the movies you hate by re reviewing the transformers movies,0
i think these movies are objectively better then any other ones tom holland is great but the movie are forgettable,0
attempt to make jeremy review watchmen tv series or movie,0
that teaser is soooo solid this movie rocked my year old self when it came out jeremy i also miss the magic of seeing trailers first at the movies its cool having access to stuff because of the internet but getting to the movies early for the trailers was such a crucial part of the experience for me,1
hey jeremy can you please review as good as it gets that movie is really worth your time by the way this review made me watching spiderman again th or th time maybe love from india,0
i was born in so this was one of the first movies i watched ever without this movie i wouldn t be the geek i am today and i love it,0
man we re desperate for content at this point aren t we hey how about instead of reviewing random trash you review some oscar award winning movies that weren t mainstream or review your favorite movies isn t the whole point of reviewing something to give people an idea on whether or not to watch something they haven t what s the whole point in reviewing something we ve likely already seen,1
how bout v for vendetta,0
review watchmen,1
when you inevitably shave and get a hair cut you should give zero warning in fact you should make the thumbnail a picture of you still looking all grizzly to shock us more,1
not been for a haircut yet,0
spider man homecoming,0
how in the hell was this not made already,0
chocked on my cinnamon toast crunch,1
best spider man movie,0
first movie i ever saw in theaters and my favorite film ever made it s what got me into loving films in the first place,0
great video bro,0
pausing at this is about the trade towers in new york city in the spiderman trailer confirmed eh actually it is just about his love for spiderman trailer the more you know,0
this original spider man suit is in the all time hall of fame for movie costumes,0
j k simmons is just the best in these movies,0
that movie was amazing,0
ur looking like tom cruise in the last samurai,0
reviewing sam raimi spider man fans so you have chosen death,1
me reads title this video is years old me reads the date also me wow ohhh,1
no your out jeremy out of your mind,1
i trust your opinion more with the new look it s like you care more about films than grooming,0
do all of them like nostalgia critic did trilogy andrew garfield duology,0
bring back william dafoe as norman osborn for the mcu,0
can we agree that he has to watch the editors cut of spiderman and not the theatrical cut of the movie,0
love the movie love the review love your hair tbf spider man is not that bad jeremy please interstate review,0
don t apologise for telling a story that encapsulates what we all felt when we first laid eyes on that trailer i never cause any sort of disruptions in movie theaters but when i realised it was a spiderman movie the yes that came out of my mouth was the loudest i d ever produced sorry had to pause the video to say this please continue,0
yo you should review umbrella academy,0
pizza time,0
finally never clicked so fast on one of your videos,0
bring back tobey,0
just watched the trailer he was talking about that was the worst trailer i ve ever seen if i had seen that before the movie movies i probably wouldn t have been a spiderman fan,0
william dafoe was perfect,0
i watched the teaser and tried to imagine seeing that the first time at a movie theater before some other movie and after almost two decades i still got chills and i still love spidy the most,0
this movie is the greatest spiderman movie ever non of the future spiderman movies hasn t captured the true spiderman like this,0
i only hear nickleback when watching this movie,1
jeremy please watch and review train to busan,0
yessss finally agree with everything also in the rd one sony forced sam rami to add venom and he hated the character plus they wouldn t give him extra time to finish the movie at his own pace so i think he ruined venoms part on purpose bc everything with sandman is amazing there s also like a ton of deleted scenes that would ve made it x better but had to be cut for runtime,1
watch the editors cut of spiderman it makes it slightly better,1
spiderman please,0
i didn t have a problem with the goblin helmet until i saw the prototype green goblin mask a few years back now i kinda wished we got that instead,0
jeremy please review either or both sao abridged or dbz abridged don t really see many reviewers talk about them but both are done well enough imo to deserve a review,0
toby was a perfect spidey don t me,1
you look like john wick wear it with pride,0
jeremy is lookin like john wick omg,0
can you please review the film changeland directed by seth green please the movie is really goo i highly recommend it so please please,0
jeremy with the logan look,0
we all know j k simmons stole the show,0
no matter how much you do for them eventually they will hate you hmmm sounds like the police to me,1
hobo jeremy is my favorite jeremy,0
spider man and from raimi are still my favorite spider man movies,0
i was when this came out and my big brother took me to see it this is my spiderman,0
bonesaw is ready,0
palm springs is a new movie it s a hulu origonal please review palm springs hulu origonal,0
man if spider man got awesometacular you re going to have to invent a new tag for spider man,0
smart humans the spectacular spider man,0
this was an amazing movie,0
tobey will always be the one and only spider man and raimi s style is just so perfect for spidey,1
now for another iconic force for good that prowled the rooftops of new york city review teenage mutant ninja turtles,0
pizza time,0
i m glad you re good jeremy,0
that s the thing about the raimi trilogy that the other spidey movies failed to capture each movie felt so grand like an event and celebration of the character that had such impactful themes while also being so fun with the mcu spidey it just seems more like a fun time which isn t bad but it just feels like another episode in the sea of marvel movies i feel like that s actually a problem with a lot of recent superhero movies as of late compared to the ones back in the early s and s,1
i hated tobey s face and his voice and i can t see beyond that anymore i iked it fine when it came out it was the first and only movie about spidey but the movie did not age well for me spiderman i still hate tobey s face peter is a geek not a dork with a pucheable face but that movie is almost perfect for me despite him honestly i ll take the amazing spiderman both of them over this one and the third one any day of the week,0
this channel is awesome tacular man ps spiderman is still as bad as i remember it being i m sure but i ll watch the video if you make it lmao,0
spider man plz,0
this channel is becoming a chronicle of jeremy s slow descent into notgivingafuckness,1
you need to review stallone s nighthawk and don t forget the aviators,0
wait jeremy reads comments ight well if he does a review of goodfellas then that ll be true i guess we can just wait and see,1
surprised he didn t do this already,0
if you were a kid in the early s you were enthralled by this movie you owned the vhs tape and loved watching every bit of it and then you would the music video for hero right after,0
i love this movie and i think the second one is even better as good as willem dafoe is alfred molina is also fantastic and it s probably the most overlooked performance of a villain in any movie the newer ones are okay but i can t stand zendaya,0
finally,0
one of the all time greatest superhero films ever made not only that next to superman and batman and blade and x men it s also one of the most important comic book movies ever made this movie practically raised me it s one of my all time favorite films superhero or not tobey maguire is and forever will be the best live action peter parker spider man ever can t wait to see your review for spider man,1
attempt to get jeremy to review death stranding number,0
yeeehhh i m liking the disheveled deranged look mr j keep it up fella,0
the most memorable movie of my middle school years i remember hearing that the scene with the helicopter was going to be cut out after which was a given of course,0
great review now can you please also do umbrella academy,0
will you do spiderman with the best doctor octopus,0
the real emotion for this movie truly brings a tear to my eyes alexa play sandman s confession,1
do you know how much i ve sacrificed,1
sam raimi s spiderman and spiderman are the definitive punch of spiderman movies iron man jr doesn t come close,0
finally this made my day,0
review and and when you do compare the alternate cuts to the theatrical cuts,0
spider man and are my favorite super hero movies by far,0
pizza time,0
i didn t ask for this all i m asking for is for you to review palm springs love you jeremy,0
no matter how much you ve done for them eventually they will hate you that s spider man in a nutshell,0
so perfect in fact they used him in a different spider man series,1
ahhh when things were simple i wanna go back edit thank you for the nostalgia jeremy,1
you ll get your review when you fix this damn door,0
spider man next,0
best spiderman trilogy,0
agreed perfect start to an amazing wink wink trilogy and yes that includes because despite its flaws it still hits home emotionally it really grew on me over the years and whenever i put the disc of spidey in i am pumped for all,0
jeremy looking more like moses every vid,0
first movie i remember seing in theater as kid this shit is truly my childhood willem dafoe s green goblin is like my darth vader ps them quotes too out am i back to formula no one says no to me the best simply the best,0
review tron legacy,1
yeah tobey maguire is my spiderman great review jeremy and stay safe and take care,1
i ve never clicked so fast,0
can you review the series of games you should have reviewed ages ago you love it i love it you have a tattoo for it review the lok series already,0
do big lebowski,0
do a review on catch me if you can,0
my favorite super hero is still spider man,0
first jurassic park,0
it is comparable with the old animated series and much better than the nano suit stark spiderman,0
tobey maguire is the best peter parker spiderman in live action the other two have their moments and have the cgi to be better not character wise raimis s original spiderman is the best,0
love the movie clip placements perfect haha,0
jeremy is slowly changing into charles manson,0
hot take i honestly can t decide if i like this movie or the amazing spider man more i prefer how the origin was done more in this movie but gwen stacy was a better love interest i also prefer toby s peter parker over andrew s but i like both of their portrayals of spider man,1
the three forms of jeremy pasty geek suave geek geek messiah,1
please review grand budapest hotel,0
raimi s spider man remains the undisputed champ for me it focuses on the characters and the substance rather than the cgi and beautiful action garfield s spider man just didn t happen and holland s spider man has a stellar cast that could be incredible but is sadly wasted i just don t care about any of these new characters,1
danny elfman s theme for this film is fire as iconic as batman,0
if you read comments then predator and jaws,0
since you re reviewing classics can you make a review for gladiator btw i ve been watching you since your movie review fell in love with your vibe ever since man keep doing what you re doing,0
watching the final hand to hand fight between the green goblin and spiderman as a kid was brutal,0
spider man is still in the top superhero movies of all time,0
the sam raimi spider man series was what got me into spider man and to the marvel universe as a whole when i was a kid my dad him being a huge dc fan tried to get me into superman and batman but neither character really resonated with me when i saw this movie for the first time as a kid peter parker was so relatable that even as a kid i cared what happened to him as both peter and spider man this movie pushed me to read spider man comics and got me into the marvel universe as a whole i saw both sm and in theaters i read a lot of old amazing spider man and ultimate spider man comics and watched both the s spider man cartoon and the spectacular spider man series and while i also loved other marvel heroes such as iron man and captain america pre mcu days no character in all of fiction resonates with me as much as spider man does and that all started with sam raimi and his vision of spider man,1
spiderman are the definitive spiderman movies,0
if you watch spiderman you have to watch the extended edition and yes there is an extended edition the fight scenes are longer and way more awesome,0
okay now spiderman and please,0
the names of j jonah jameson robbie robertson and betty brant can t be coincidence,0
rami triology is cold classic spider man will for ever be the spiderman for me and rd was ok but i blame studio for messing with sam raimi s vision and screwing up the th movie oh the movie that could have been but these movies had heart unlike mcu spider man current even though tom holland is good he just actor playing a part but toby s character got into a heart,0
been saying it for years,0
please review the the punisher movie,0
that cameo by the man himself macho man aka randy savage was savage rip,0
ahh the spider man review about time lol,1
everything you said on your review for spider man was on point totally agree i always compared sam raimi spider man to the spiderman animated series and spiderman for ps i don t know why though i still got my poster for sam raimi s spider man all three music score soundtrack also that catchy song from the end credits with the song sang by chad kroger by the band nickleback and also spiderman theme song played by aerosmith so badass and awesome just going say the soundtrack for all films are spectacular the kellogs cereal surprises promo too i remember asking for the cereal to get the prizes in my opinion my favorite of the trilogy is spiderman movies jeremy i have an idea what you going to say on that specific sequel lol xd thank you for sharing your life as a projectionist i like it when you talk about the simpler times,1
hey i was the guy that kept commenting for jeremy to review the raimi spider man movies nice he shouted me out,0
the only spider man movie that tops this one is sam raimi s spider man yes you read this like you re yelling in your head tho don t really yell this because your neighbors will think you re crazy oh you are crazy you say well this is just getting awkward,0
love this movie and jeremy reminds me why i do great review,0
yasss i ve been wanting this review for freaking years thank you jeremy you sir are the goat,0
you should review zerozerozero on amazon prime,0
do not engage spider man,0
jeremy i don t want to bore you with a life story fans who miss the journal videos,1
review kill the irishman,0
captain happy sun bro the best never seen movie,0
finally remember when i subbed to jeremy years ago i immediately was bummed he didn t review sam raimi s spiderman trilogy it s about time,0
jeremy what about spider man miles moralas on ps,0
was spiderman really that bad i remember enjoying it back in the day,1
review the night comes for us it s an awesome spiritual successor to the raid,0
you need to check out corridor digital s film about an anatomically correct spider man,1
the camera transitions in this movie was amazing i d say this spider man movie has the most distinct style from all other spider man movies i remember seeing this back in like it was yesterday,0
jeremy since you loved the raid movies so much you need to review the night comes for us,0
why not review a movie that came out this year on amazon prime called the exigency if you are feeling brave enough,0
i just want to see jeremy drinking apple cider from the coffee mug in bath robe,1
i was when this movie came out on dvd the scene were gg breaks into aunt may s gave me nightmares for weeks,1
jeremy when you re watch spider man please watch the editor s cut,1
glad you re ok jeremy last video had me saying both right there with ya and oh fuck right there with ya you ok man,0
serpico jeremy is right about the teaser trailer i saw it in the theater and it was mind blowing on the big screen,0
i ve legit just been reenacting the final fight with the goblin with my nephew which was hilarious and came in and saw this on my feed you sure are wizard,0
j jonah jameson alone made this trilogy times better than all other spiderman movies,0
you re not a fan of the goblin suit excuse me,0
does that mean if i post persistently you d review soul reaver legacy of kain series,0
spiderman and days of future s past are my favorite superhero films buy a wide margin,0
willem dafoe is the joker and you can t convince me otherwise,0
anything below awesometacular and we would ve become nemeses jj,0
nice beard jeremy,0
worst spiderman ever,0
i ve always preferred the organic web shooters over the web shooters he creates,0
spider man would have been better than any mcu spider movie,0
i was a projection at a movie theater too,0
i think is how most of us felt about the spiderman lol,0
i appreciate your dedication to keeping out spoilers but i think it s been long enough both for past and current spider man movies,0
you re right this spider man was a game changer at the time gave me all the feels like you i also get transported back to the time i first saw it,0
you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain one of the best movie quotes ever i still remember going to see spider man opening day had gone to see a pm show with my friends but it was sold out so we saw something else after getting out of that movie i noticed that the midnight show wasn t sold out yet so i raced home to grab my little sister and breaking every speed limit imaginable raced back to the theater hoping they still had tickets managed to snag two and found two seats in an otherwise packed full theater good times lol,1
i still love this movie i feel while is better had more fun into spiderverse the best of all spidey movies though,0
if he doesn t give this an awesomtacular he s stupid,0
can u do autopsy of jane doe pleasseee,0
spider man was the first superhero movie i ever watched it changed my life spider man is great as well and i ve always liked spider man despite it s flaws it s underrated imo,1
jeremy is turning into geralt of rivia,0
what a fun story at the beginning those first movies were slightly before my time so i don t have the cool memories attached that you do but these were definitely the ones that were definitively my spider man in my mind i wasn t reading comics yet and there wasn t like different spider man cartoons on so this for a while just was spider man for me this is gna get a lot of flack but tom holland is definitely my spidey now but i still have so much respect for what sam raimi was able to achieve with these films and how like you said it along with x men happy th btw really defined the genre going forward but if you are indeed reading the comments then surely you know how bad we want a red dead review,0
sam raimi s trilogy is the best spiderman trilogy and the most nostalgic movies for me since they are the first superhero movies i saw along with nolan s batman trilogy the cast is amazing throughout all movies maybe venom wasn t the best music pieces and soundtracks amazing the comic book style editing is iconic and touches upon every aspect of peter s character yes i like cool peter parker great themes explored and great movies in general i never get tired of this trilogy sam raimi s spiderman is iconic tobey maguire best peter parker nuff said,1
spider man isn t as bad as it s rap would suggest though it does suffer a bit from being disjointed sandman is amazing though and i actually think stupid dancing symbiote is perfect for what the symbiote represents in bringing out the inner badness of someone and in peter parker that deep evil is just this lowkey jerk not a monster of envy and spite like it is with brock,0
wow reviews in days awesometacular,0
please do the other two raimi movies,0
you re the one who s out gobby out of your mind,1
literally just watched spider man this past sunday perfect timing,0
let s not forget one of the most perfect casting decisions ever j k simmons as j jonah jameson,1
apocalypse jeremy is looking like he walked out from a quite place,0
jeremy i would really love to hear what you think of a space odessy i ve been watching since the days of revenge of the fallen and oh wow you just said while i m typing this hahah anyway would love to see you tackle that film plus the attention it would get from your video would allow others to see the masterpiece,0
yesssss,0
dude do a review on red dead redemption or undead nightmare i been commenting for years still love ya work bro,0
you know how much i ve sacrificed,0
i knew this review was coming when jeremy dropped a few seconds of the final swing on instagram,0
i was year old when i saw spider man it was a classic and what they did for spider man blew my mind i loved the score and the actors,0
greatest superhero origin film ever nuff said,0
please keep the beard lol awesome reviews as always spider man with tobey maguire is forever my preference,1
i ve been waiting for this since ahahahha,0
this movie changed my life when i was a kid back in,1
jermy please review the new movie trailer the devil all the time it has a lot of good actors,0
the raimi trilogy will always be classic nothing can top it better stories better development and better fights no avengers except dr strange no tony stark no villians hating on tony and taking it out peter,1
ohhhhhhhh it s time spider pig spider pig does whatever a spider pig does oh wait wrong movie but still woot sam raimi spidey,0
oh my god it s fucking spider man,0
when you watch spider man do it to enjoy it ironically it s one of the best god damn comedies but only in irony good luck,0
why are u reviewing the movies now,0
waiting for spider man jeremy,0
yes this movie is magical my son is a spiderman nerd and he loves toby maguire as the web head the casting is on point are quite excellent but was hard to get behind sam did say that he didnt understand venom he took the heat for the movie that is a stand up guy i m bias towards toby s spidey as hes the st however i do like all the others also wish andrew had more time in the suit better writers i m getting back into writing and dialogue so i m picking apart movies shows novels more now to help me be a better writer,0
in my opinion the goblins suit is perfection it looks like a tough armor while also enhancing his movement and strength on top of the gas that already make him superhuman and the open mouth is awesome,0
the goblin laugh is epic,0
don t worry jeremy we know what you wanted to say,0
j k simmons is so perfect as jj that basically nobody else can play him,0
raimi s spidey and spidey in general taught me how to grow as a person and i m forever grateful for him even if he isn t real,1
yeah attempts only jk never requested it once don t call me a liar pleaseeee,0
jeremy is in his mufasa phase,0
here before k views,0
does anyone else think the elevator guy looks like him,0
jeremy thank you for reviewing this movie even though you are reviewing movies whenever you can please do the following rambo trilogy predator robocop the terminator stargate and many more,0
the fact that randy savage bruce campbell and octavia spencer were all in one scene pleases me deeply,1
review the peanut butter falcon plz,0
review the peanut butter falcon plz,0
tobey maguire as spider man or not it will always be pizza time in the marvel universe,1
review the peanut butter falcon,0
sam raimi s spiderman trilogy wall crawled so the mcu can run,1
sam raimi s spider man and spider man for superhero movies are just a whole other caliber of film they are not only the benchmark for any marvel character film but for any superhero movie at all they define what it means to be a hero and truly gave the struggle of dealing with that burden no other superhero movies better showcase with great power comes great responsibility,0
jeremy s hair beard and jacket are becoming one,1
lmao that no spoiler part about jjj,0
i would suggest you try getting your hands on the editor s cut of spiderman it is a slight improvement over the theatrical if you can sit through both versions for that video it would make for a great comparison,0
people poop on too much yeah venom was a twig and there was that horrible emo peter parker bit but the overall plot was up to par i really liked sandman it was all just a bit cheesy but thats the spiderman way,0
came out on my birthday may rd best birth date for a nerd,0
the best spider man movie until spider man was released and then later spider man homecoming,0
maaaaannn i was so happy to see this thank you jeremy,0
it s a dream come true you finally reviewed them if you do the nd and rd you have officially reviewed every spider man movies not including the nicholas hammond ones,0
is jeremy cosplaying as keanu reeves,0
doom patrol is a show you would love,0
this movie looks trash nothing can come close to the sam raimi originals,0
jeremy please do dni or days in this quarantine the movie will completely break you,0
not the movie review we deserved but the one one needed,0
please compile all awsometacular movies and tv show since you haven t steered me wrong,0
the beard is going grey,0
this movie to me is the best spiderman movie ever created,1
anyone wants him to review the movie virus,0
that was not minutes time doesn t go by that fast,0
i will always stand by saying that these spiderman movies are dogshit,0
i didn t like it that much i thought embodies spider man better,0
the early mid s i missed those days,1
review the monster squad,0
spider man spider man does whatever a spider can,0
is it a good omen that sam replaces a director for the second time,0
i grew to like venom in the third movie it feels like it s an actual alien eddie as venom was creepy strange if it was real life i think spiderman s venom would be scarier than og venom i think it was a great movie despite its very cringy moments,0
back when spiderman villains were hated spiderman because of legit reasons and not because of tony stark,1
attempt to make jeremy review cobra kai season,0
jeremy the barbershops are open up again,0
thank you for this fun review and for me it s a classic superhero movie among few,0
sam raimi is great as long you keep him on a short leash no offense he goes off the rails in,0
i think you used the word logistically wrong unless you were referring to the way he shoots his webs lol,0
please get a haircut,0
i remember seeing this on dvd when i was little the green goblin gave me actual nightmares he scared the shit outta me when i was little xd i was a odd child,1
real funny commentary track also,0
jeremy can grow a helluva beard jahns,1
jeremy needs to see the show spectacular spider man,1
imo unpopular opinion i loved the whole trilogy as a kid now its hard to like cause the super toxic and terrible raimi spider man fan community,0
mary jane is in some sort of danger cliche,1
i ve heard that the footage from that trailer was supposed to be the debut of the suit in the movie would have been better than they way it was handled in the movie,0
sam raimi s spiderman was timeless,1
in x men welcomed me to superhero movies in spider man made me fall in love with superhero movies,0
sony knew they couldn t find another human for j j so they had to use him again in the tom holland series and that was fucking sweet sony is realizing these movies are almost perfect j k simmons in holland movies cliff robertsons voice over in spider verse,0
this spider man movie was my childhood i ve seen it twice when i was years old and it blew me away in the theater one of my top favorite movies of all time,0
worldclassbullshitters says it was the first uniting movie after that got everyone excited i agree you should do a quick livestream with them,0
i first saw the spiderman trailer just before final fantasy in imax it was a great surprise,0
was kinda expecting to hear oh boy yeah when he gave the movie an awesometacular,1
no mention of bruce campbell or macho man savage criminal,0
hey,0
tobey maguire is the first and best spider man raimi s holy trilogy will live on forever spider man is the best superhero film ever made,1
finally i ve always wondered why you never reviewed this this is awesome also you dont have to make a video but ghost of tsushima is getting a sweet multiplayer,0
still one of my favorite spidery films,0
no spoilers hehehe i know,0
the twin tower commercial is predictive programming,1
please review primer,0
i loved the movie when it first came out i still really enjoy it though i would say superhero movies have evolved to outclass it since retroactively i would say that it is neither better nor worse than a good movie,0
good story really cool unique sneak peak into the dawn of the epic superhero movie era,0
it was the best one,0
me building up the courage to unsubscribe from a youtuber who i ve watched for so long grow and unfortunately become progressively waaaayyyyy more annoying,0
first film is great the second film is awesome the third film is forgettable,0
imagine if raimi got to do what he wanted with sm and vs studio getting in the way,0
imo in the minority the first was better than the other two,0
now do a review of dragonfly,1
agree my friend was a projectionist as well and gave me and our friends the inside lane to that trailer it was amazing too bad peter isn t a journalist in the new movies or at least aspiring,0
now do spider man,0
does anyone else want jeremy to sing john williams superman theme,0
nobel prize jeremy nobel prize,0
this has a special place in my heart growing up i loved the spider man franchise sam raimi s but once i got older and the tasm series came out it sold me on that franchise as the favorite movies andrew for me is my spider man but don t worry i still love sam raimi s version,0
i watched this yesterday again for the first time in forever because im watching all the new age movies in marvel after blade no lie what a coincidence in timing,0
the raimi trilogy will never be matched by any other spider man trilogy unless they go ahead with spiderverse and they turn out,1
honestly i like jeremy s hair but the beard needs a little grooming even though its phenominal,1
review some s animated stuff that you remember from childhood like batman tas spider man tas or anything you loved in particular,0
yes finally,0
after raimi s spiderman trilogy review dark i d like to hear your thoughts about it,0
who brings in the pictures of spider man i don t know his stuff comes in the mail jeremy oh jj cares about parker and his employees despite how loud angry and ruthless he is nostalgia critic you gotta explain it,1
spider man will always be top spidey films i get why you said for me but frfr it should be that way for every single person who s seen it dammit,0
whenever i think of j jonah jameson i think of j k simmons,1
desperado review,0
this movie is gold,0
omg its happening,0
my personal ranking of the sam raimi spider man trilogy spider man good time no alcohol required spider man buy on blu ray spider man good time but get some beer to make it way more enjoyable,0
jeremy idk if u will do it again but do the christopher s batman trilogy review again good sir tc or something like revisited not a review per say d,1
dude you look like a wise men,0
review diary of a wimpy kid movies,0
i actually think the beard and hair suit you really well they re both well kept and soft looking,0
gotta say i dig your hairstyle and beard,0
imma be real with y all i think these three movies are better than the entire mcu why there s soul and heart in it mcu reeks of cynicism and is absolutely hollow,0
the studio forcing venom along with the other two villains is what killed the rd raimi had a clear vision as stated by jeremy that was set up in the first movie but ya know greed and all that que ser ser,0
wait how old are you,0
the movie that made me fall in love with comic books,0
even though this film is iconic i still blame raimi for making millions of kids believe that spiderman could throw web out of his wrists web wrists are fucking disgusting,0
you won t love spider man it hasn t aged well,0
if you read comments then go watch dark on netflix,0
i grew up with these movies as a kid and as a kid i remember loving spider man as well now i love spider man and and admit has some problems but still has great scenes meaning it did have potential to be a great movie if sony didn t interfere i m also a huge fan of the mcu spider man i love spider man homecoming and love tom holland s spider man in the mcu movies i don t relate to the people that love the raimi films but hate homecoming or tom holland as spider man or even dislike i just don t get that i love both spider man and also love spider man homecoming this is what i like about jeremy he loves the raimi spider man films but doesn t seem to have his nostalgia googles on when talking about other spider man movies considering how he gave spider man homecoming an awesometacular rating it seems fans of the raimi films or people who grew up with the raimi usually hate or dislike homecoming or love the raimi films so much that anything that isn t them isn t good and like i said i just don t get that it s not like i grew up with mcu spider man either i grew up with tobey s spider man and the raimi spider man i mean i was born in so i literally grew up with them but i just can t get myself to relate to the other people that clearly grew up with the raimi films except for jeremy who like me loves the first two raimi films and loves homecoming,0
this might be one of the last times we see jeremy with this beard before heading back to the theaters this weekend depending on if his state has any movie theaters open,0
jeremy definitely needs to review the spectacular spider man if he loves the raimi movies as much as we do he will love this show,0
can t wait for him to review spider man lol,0
boi i really love you reviewing classics,0
i wouldn t say this for any other movie but if this was any less than awesometacular i would have unsubscribed,1
it was the first english hollywood movie i watched as a kid travelled all the way to a big city with my dad just to watch it in the theatre ah the memories by the way are we getting a review of the expanse,0
the human spider best scene of this movie,0
the fact the legend bruce campbell was the first actor to say spider man on the big screen is still the most amazing thing to me,1
i would love to see your review for movie the fourth kind with milla jovovich,0
a surprise to be sure but a welcome one,1
i now wanna see a podcast of jeremy and alex of hi top films discuss raimi s spider man movies,0
please review the lighthouse,1
mr jeremy please do a review of superman,0
can u review disney s descendants please,0
does this mean he s obligated to do also i think so jeremy,0
i can admit that tasm has the most comic accurate suit but the raimi suit is still my favourite,0
jeremy please review the show banshee it s got anthony starr from the boys it s amazing,1
watch dark on netfix,0
you know i didn t care a lot for these movies but j k simmons was fantastic,0
i was when spider man came out the first superhero movie for me in a long line of superhero flims,0
soul reaver review when,0
best bit macho man randy savage bonesaw whatda ya doing up there,0
the third movie was two movies shoved into one and that is were it fell,0
i like the mcu spiderman but my biggest gripe is the lack of harry osborn ned is good but he s just a ganke ripoff it feels like they wanted to do miles but chickened out peter without harry is like harry potter without ron weasley,0
why did jeremy growing a beard all of a sudden make him sound like jake johnson,0
i kinda dislike the beard and hair it just feels off since i m used to seeing you beard less,0
i know exactly what jeremy will think of spider man he will have the same opinions as pretty much it this movie has good parts i personally think that it could have been so much better if they split that movie into two i loved when chris stuckmann talked about how he would have made that movie,0
if you want to watch the best of the trilogy i will have to say its strong villain and a decent relationship story before the cheese in,0
hey jeremy when you see spider man make sure you watch both the theatrical editors cut of the film,0
yes,0
jk simmons is the best in the spiderman trilogy he s sucked and far from home actually the movie sucked,0
ohhh he should review the editors cut of sm,0
still the best spider man movies ever sam raimi touched my childhood and touched my adulthood too because i m a horror fan now,0
the final battle in this movie is brutal shook me when i was younger so cool so real rami nailed it i wish there were more scenes like that in the marvel movies,1
tobey is the best peter parker and is my favorite he has the best movie sm andrew is maybe the best spidey and have the best suit tasm and amazing chemistry with emma stone tom is the most comic accurate and is both a good peter and spidey,0
finally can we also do the rest of the trilogy,0
jeremy looks like motorcycle fetish jesus,0
spider man spoiler review,1
honestly jeremy you ve never looked better,0
unpopular oppinion spider man is my favorite spider man trilogy movie and spider man is my least favorite,1
i was in,0
i have never agreed more with one of your reviews than this one jeremy love it sequel next,0
,0
i saw the trailer in the final fantasy spirits within,0
is it just me or did the way the video was edited change a little bit is it more professional or something fluent idk all i know is that i like the way the video was edited without compromising what he was trying to say,0
r i p laura ziskin thanks for bringing this franchise to life,0
please keep the beard,0
my all time favorite spiderman film,0
r i p uncle ben,0
while many people hate the mcu for being excessive everyone loves this one for being simple,1
the trailer was attached to final fantasy spirits within,0
mans lookin like john wick rn,0
i prefer the raimi films spiderman included to any of the reboots,1
these movies get some hate now for some reason but in context of the time this movie was great and honestly the story and characters hold up amazingly well like tell me what scene from the tom holland spidermans can compare with the thanksgiving scene in this one and spidey isn t even in that scene,0
hey jeremy don t feel down about not getting any chicks in high school it s not like chicks can spray white sticky goo out of their bodies like our friendly neighborhood spiderman,0
finally he reviews a good spider man movie,1
i cracked it jeremy is auditioning to play joel in the live action the last of us series,0
you should review scott pilgrim vs the world,0
i m glad jeremy is ok,0
that ending fight scene is brutal af,0
please do the tax collector shit is so bad,0
i miss the original spiderman s trilogy with sam raimi as our director and toby maguire as our spiderman back then when spiderman was still an independent hero and not a freaking sidekick,1
spider man is great,0
the sam raimi spider man films spider man into the spiderverse those are my favorite spider man movie experiences,1
fuck yeah jeremy this movie is my childhood seen this million times let s go,0
please plllleaseeee watch review the tv show mr robot it s really really good,0
dude you officially have become a hippie,0
long have i waited for this,0
i love this movie,0
danny elfman s score was amazing af,1
i think i ve seen this and spiderman like a hundred times this channel back in the day axn always fucking played it like every weeks,0
unpopular opinion spider man the dark knight,0
this is always my favorite spiderman movie tobey is also a great peter parker and a close tie with holland for the best the biggest problem i have with the movie is the green goblin suit my friend summed it up perfectly by calling it a rejected power rangers suit,0
spider man is next right right,0
finally thanks jeremy,0
you gotta review spider man and now jeremy,0
my mans looking like over here looking like punished venom jeremy,0
do highlander,0
i actually enjoy this one better than the second one mostly cause of nostalgia,0
yes yes yes yes yes,0
just taking a shot in the dark here but what are the chances we can get a dragon ball evolution review just curious,0
now play lunar silver star story complete,0
spider man awesometacular spider man awesometacular spider man it s a good time if you re drunk,0
we all know jeremy was about to say jk simmons is so good they brought him back in an entirely different universe,0
man even though spider man is having a golden age between the new live action and animated movies as well as the playstation games this trilogy will always be near and dear to my heart,0
i thought this film was awesome saw it times at my local theater it s just good fun what happened to movies like that,0
something the sam raimi spider man movie does that modern superhero movies forget to do is that it shows us how the community responds to spider man the new yorkers feel like actual people and in each movie we see how grateful they are for spider man being there for them,0
i wondee if peter parker would get away with the that s a cool outfit did your husband give it to you raimi was ahead of his time,0
dude is seriously not that bad,0
jeremy growing out samurai hair,0
i think pretty much it described my feelings towards the raimi trilogy perfectly the mcu films are fine but this is like a movie this movie is like a time capsule of an era where comic book films were still coming into their own and because of that everyone was giving their all to make each film feel worthy of being watched by people so they feel so theatrical and epic regardless of how much smaller their stakes are compared to something like endgame i love this movie,1
what did you think about the movie you should have left staring kevin bacon,0
so looking forward to what he thinks of spider man lmao,0
don t you dare to compare tobey with holland,0
the raimi s spider man movies will always be the best,0
no spoilers come on man everyone already knows,1
best spider man movie to date,0
i know that early s were a transition from the s but it s weird to hear him call it a s movie maybe it s just that i was when this movie came out and i grew up watching this on vhs so being an early s kid i remember that time as it s own thing different from s movies and different from movies that came years later,0
spider man next,0
one of the most quotable movies of all time my personal favorite oh that s cold norman osborn,0
people keep saying i m bias because of nostalgia but in my opinion what s missing in today s spider man movies is the epic iconic feeling of truly seeing a hero in spider man sam raimi captured that perfectly yes the dialogue is cheesy but you knew that this was someone you could look up to it s not tom holland s fault but i can t look up to his nor can i do the same with garfields i just think that s a key thing missing in the current generation of spider man movies,0
owned the spider man as collection by my pops coworker friends who worked in disc replay before that it was family video store first one is highlight cause of the co cast members jk simmons william defoe of course spider man peter parker,0
please review the american gods series love your videos,0
man this was a great review and i can t wait for you to review spidey and also i don t know if you do re reviews where you review the movie again because i would love to see your thoughts on the amazing spider man movie if you had patreon i d pay you to review,0
before there was ironman there was spider man come at me bruh lol,0
i remember getting a spiderman glove from a movie magazine my first ever movie merchandise which i ve just found recently,0
i read hugh jackman had a cameo planned for the film but they couldn t get his costume so the cameo was unfortunately scrapped,1
anyone who hasn t somehow played the marvel s spiderman game get on that,0
i love that main theme danny elf man is a genius also i love the cheesy comic book feel this movie brings,0
i was seven years old when this movie came out it is so engraved in my childhood that whenever i rewatch it takes me back to simpler times love this movie,0
if you read the comments answer this question have you seen sons of anarchy,0
the portal scene from endgame and the assemble scene from the avengers were both truly inspirational but i think j jonah sacrificing himself for peter in spiderman may have them beat,0
he got me on don t go yet,0
you know i was going to bed but hey what s another minutes,0
agreed i was like years old when this movie came out ever since then been my all time favorite super hero,0
damn that film strip of that trailer must be worth a fortune,0
jeremy please for the love of god review tropic tunder or district,0
pizza time,1
please do the man from earth movie review so more people can watch that hidden gem,1
i disagree the movie has aged poorly and the cheese does get in the way of my enjoyment it s too cringe maguire is also really annoying the role well that s my opinion and i realize it s an unpopular one i just hate maguire in this role he s such a wet blanket,0
review johny got his gun pleasee,0
ive been asking for this review since holy fucking shit,0
this movie made willem dafoe and jk simmons into meme icons,1
growing up with this movie was absolute pog made me smile that jeremy gave it an awesometacular awesome,0
jeremy has been doing acid,0
jeremyjahns are we gonna get another vlog anytime soon i was enjoying them lol,0
you should do the review of la casa de papel sometime as its hyped as hell,0
do the tax collector next,0
am i the only one who loves the goblin outfit in spider man,0
slowly day by day jeremy is turning into a caveman that watches movies in his cave,1
this will always be the best live action spider man fun fact the organic web shooters was james cameron s idea,1
sam raimi s spiderman is still the best realistic spiderman we have gotten thus far not trying to setup a bigger universe looking at you homecoming far from home or removing uncle ben from peter s life in favor of tony stark even if it has been done to death you don t remove ben from peter s life,1
sam raimi s trilogy yes the trilogy i m including sp is the best and the mcu spiderman can and will never reach that level sp is a good spiderman movie when it involves peter sandman and the relationship drama with mary jane it s just that sony and avi fucking arad got to greedy and arad forced raimi into putting venom in when he clearly didn t care for him at all so yes spiderman is a good movie with very good moments is it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy yes,1
do the tax collector next,0
do the tax collector next,0
i loved this movie the second one is even better the third one kinda ruins it as a series as you see some of the worst parts highlighted but damn are those first good,0
spiderman is a masterpiece,1
you rock jeremy,0
i can t go back to this movie,0
still my favorite spiderman movie,1
do the tax collector next,0
tobey maguire will always be my spider man,0
yeah pls review the raimi trilogy,0
do the tax collector next,0
something is obviously wrong with jeremy i ve been subscribed for about eight years and i ve watched his viewership plummet along with his sense of style and functionality somethings wrong in bedrock folks crack heroin,0
back,0
you know as a kid i thought the green goblin costume was waaay better than the costume i saw on the s spiderman show growing up now i kinda still like it,0
please review spider man,0
so when are you doing spider man because pizza time please have pizza while watching it,0
jeremy been the goat,1
jeremy left out talking about the soundtrack,0
when will you review disney s the little mermaid,0
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesss,0
spiderman is a masterpiece,0
finally,1
if you really do read comments you need to play the witcher and its dlcs you d have a blast and will get unbelievably hyped for the upcoming new cdpr triple a game cyberpunk,0
tobey maguire is the best spider man forever,0
f i n a l l y thank you jeremy,0
hey jeremy can you do avatar the last airbender,0
in my opinion this film did not age well at all loved it when it first released but now it s not even watchable,0
i seriously just watched spiderman and spiderman those are still the best spiderman movies ever,0
i have been replaying insomniac s spider man while wearing the maguire attire so thank you for this,0
i remember watching this movie as a kid,0
the most ground breaking about this movie was the upside down kiss,0
are you dark army identify yourself,0
where s red dead review my guy,0
thank you finally,0
jeremy finally uploads raimi s spiderman review me always a pleasure to have our board of directors visit us,0
just thinking about the score gives me chills so good,0
i am sure i would recognize it if i heard it but i can t think of the spiderman score off the top of my head,0
you ll get your rent when you fix this damn door,0
i know there is copyright issues and all that but they should put the raimi trilogy on disney especially since they are hiring raimi to direct dr strange fun fact there is a dr strange easter egg in raimi s spider man,0
tobey maguire will always be my favorite spider man everytime i would deliver a pizza it reminded of peter parker lol,1
pizza time,1
am i the only one who thinks jeremy looks good with all the hair,0
you should watch the extended cut of spider man it adds little details to the symbiote that kinda gives it a creepier characteristic same for spider man i would recommend watching spider man,0
apple juice,0
ok can we get a palmsprings review,0
i used to be close friends with a girl who hates the original spider man movies so glad we are not friends anymore,0
ok so jeremy and the saltine company has access to my emails ok,0
he looks like wolverine,0
i m gonna try n predict the ratings on next movies spider man awesometacular spider man good time if ur drunk and not a fan of venom cuz otherwise its dogshit sandman was good so that s why i m going with good time when drunk,0
you know i m something of a scientist myself,0
didn t james cameron s aquaman beat it shortly after,0
man this is the one film i could never get tired of watching honestly,1
all these years and i don t understand how did raimi get away with it,0
jeremy is not his jump cut self as of late,0
now review the bourne trilogy man still waiting,0
great review another notable thing from the first movie is peter getting his ass kicked in the final battle,0
wow i didn t remember it being that long ago you make me want to watch it again please check out i am mother on netflix,0
i think for a person born in the s or early s this was the star wars of the decade,1
you know how much i sacrificed you know i m something of a scientist myself i just got the legacy steelbooks,1
the past few movies i have watched jeremy has reviewed and i watched the rami spider man trilogy and now here we are,0
i wasn t worried about jeremy when i saw him drinking glenlivet yo that s a damn fine tasting scotch sir,0
spider man handled the character almost perfectly the side characters like aunt may uncle ben and j jonah jameson were done very well willem dafoe played a very convincing green goblin looking back my main gripe with the movie is that it didn t handle the high school aspect very well it just glanced over it,0
one perk of this quarantine has been seeing jeremy slowly turn into a crazy looking wizard,0
lowkey just made my day,0
oh boy yeah,0
i just dropped a video last week about the amazing spider man franchise if anyone is interested i have more content coming later in the week,0
he looks awesome,0
anyone born after sees through the nostalgia and sees how cheesy and childish this movie actually is,1
willem dafoe should still be the joker,0
im in the minority here and i m glad everyone grew up with this and loves it but i have to say this at last i legit despise this film others can over look the cheese but i can t seriously this is a movie that i can t last more then ten minutes with before i have to run out of whatever room is playing it but again i m sure i m the only one who feels this way and i just had to put it out there,0
china needs to release one more virus in order for jeremy to do the spiderman review,0
william dafoe killed it as the goblin misery misery misery,0
wow maybe we ll get a battle of armies spoiler talk,0
i d recommend rewatching spider man although it s not the best by far it s still a good story which i think ends the trilogy quite satisfyingly,0
jeremy they had worked on a mask that emotes for the goblin but i think it was too expensive you can see test footage on youtube,0
i hate my friend so much for shitting on this movie because he doesn t build his webs its not comic accurate it s like that one thing makes the movie unwatchable and he s ignoring everything that made it so iconic and important for the superhero genre,0
i sincerely hope that these older movie reviews continue when new movies are coming out in theaters again great stuff jeremy,0
nice review can t wait for your review for spider man my personal favorite of the sam raimi trilogy,0
i love spider man and spider man awesometacular,0
i m digging your new look,0
the final battle in that abandoned building is still one of the best fight scenes in superhero movie history i love sam raimi s spider man,0
so when is spider man,0
this movie came out when i was i grew up with cgi slowly becoming amazing but idk why whenever i look back at the first to rami spidey films i dont have an issue with any of the cgi but so many other movies it draws me way out but these give me no issues,0
honestly spiderman wasn t that bad i wish they did keep in some of the deleted scenes because was supposed to be an allegory about drugs and there effect on people and how it can change the person using them and also twist and strain the bonds with those around said person who uses drugs,0
no rush for spiderman take your time it s still amazing and spectacular,0
i had the hugest crush for the actress who played mj she started my thing for red heads i know the actress isn t an original redhead,0
if you waited to do this review any longer i would ve had to put some dirt in your eye,1
whats going on dude are you okay,0
this movie is still awesome to this day,0
i think this movie was great for it s time and still somewhat holds up today but i think comic book movies where able to take what works about this movie and change what didn t so i don t think is one of the best comic book movies just the most influential,1
is it me or does the longer this pandemic goes on the more jeremy looks like rasputin,1
my favorite spider man tobey maguire my least favorite spider man tom holland the best spider man earth spider man,1
review the raimi evil dead films,0
honorable mentions for the ending fight predictable yes but surprisingly brutal,0
this will forever be one of my favorite superhero movies ever,0
when this came out i remember thinking how is that mj having three different relationships with three different men in this movie is more believable than padme having one relationship with one man in attack of the clones,0
tobey maguire should play uncle ben in the new spider man with tom holland flashbacks,0
this is why i didn t get chicks in high school lol so worth it,1
five things i think spider man got right the costume the origin the love story green goblin j jonah jameson music,1
he doesn t read comments right,0
i wish the motivation was there for goblin after thanksgiving he has no real reason to continue going after peter it s just contrived that oh no a big bad good guy we can take over the city if he joins me but he has no motivation to take over the city my one major gripe with one of my favorite superhero movies,0
the scene on the bridge is exactly the same as the ending of batman forever,0
as muchas i enjoy having the trailers asap nowadays i really miss those old days where we had them as a surprise just like jeremy says here,0
yay,0
how about you read one piece it will change your life it s the lord of the rings of manga,0
is this review in the context of or how it has aged,0
i put a link below lies,0
jeremy grows a beautiful beard in months but i don t shave for years and i grow a single strain armpit hair,0
it took a global pandemic for jeremy and other quote critics to review classic movies,0
this is the movie that started it all a masterpiece for sure,1
but the big lebowski i love raimi spider man,0
spider man next please as it s the best one,0
you look like wolverine if he was in a pow camp in nam for a majority of the war i love it,0
my childhood so hyped to see you reviewing these can t wait for the awesometacular in and good time if you re drunk for or probably dogshit tbh it s still my biggest guilty pleasure movie since i saw it in theaters with my dad when i was,0
where is my train to busan movie review sir,0
omg is he talking about me lol,0
my favorite sam raimi spiderman movie is still the first one,0
there is a bald spot of jeremy s mustache right under his nose and that bothers me good review btw,0
the sound of the women screaming is exactly the same as the one used by no in parasite eve,0
fave j jonah jameson line has to be when peter calls him out for slandering spider man and his response was i resent that slander is spoken in print it s libel,1
i watched it on release and no movie since then has felt the same for me this was one of the greatest movies i ve experienced,0
go web flyyy up up and away web shazam go go go web go i love this movie so much and spider man is an absolute masterpiece,1
spider man was the first movie i remembered watching on tv and i am just,0
i used to be edgey and say that tom holland was the best spiderman simply because he was more comic accurate and he was young and he was quippy but after several years its dawned on me that that was a shallow argument tom holland is indeed a good spiderman but sam rami s i think is more true to the chatacter by how he is dorky and constantly struggles with his life but still chooses to be spiderman also heartbreaking scenes where aunt may is blaming herself for uncle ben s death and having to deal with overdue bills are nowhere to be found in the mcu spiderman films that spiderman never really struggles with everything and he never deals with consequences to his choices like being a jerk to uncle ben or not attending mary jane s plays etc tobey maguire maguire spiderman takes life lessons he is taught by other people and uses them to defuse the situation as seen with doctor octopus in spiderman again mcu spiderman is fun but is not nearly as deep as sam rami s trilogy even spiderman with the sandman scenes,0
how many peoples first superhero film experience was this spider man,0
do speedracer next just bc,0
i haven t watched this movie in a long time i predict that if i rewatched it that i would still really enjoy it,0
mary jane was the one thing about this franchise i didn t like also does anyone else notice how f cked up peter mary and harry s relationship is mary doesn t like peter at first and dates harry then she flirts with peter and french passionately kisses a masked man she s met once before for a couple of seconds while she was still with harry and peter is okay with kissing his best friend s girl,1
before pizza time existed,0
i ve always loved the green goblin suit and something that i kind of miss about spider man that you get a lot of in these movies and the some of in the andrew garfield movies is that spider man had real fights where he punched the villains i really like the mcu spider man movies but for some reason they don t let him hit anyone he never throws a punch in any of the movies he s been in,0
yay the superior spiderman,0
guess i know what movie im watching tonight,0
review dark on netflix,0
and now j jonah is back,0
for me spider man blu ray spider man awesometacular spider man alcohol required,0
could you review train to busan one of the best zombie films i have seen love the videos,1
i think when j jonah didn t rat out peter a big reason was bc if he did then he wouldn t get pics of spider man anymore,1
i dont care if i get hate for this but sam raimi spiderman is the best spiderman,0
thank you thank you thank you to this day the best movies adapted from marvel comic books yet,1
never clicked on a video with so much excitement like this,0
never clicked so damn fast,0
yes now spiderman,0
you gonna do all three of the raimi movies,0
no spoilers nevermind this movie is older than some of your fans jeremy,1
awesometacular review now do blade,0
il be honest i have missed afew of these the last couple of weeks what the hell happened to you,0
jeremy please review avatar the last airbender,0
hi sir jeremy you re my youtube inspiration i m also trying to have a steady review channel do you have any tips for me,0
spider man moral of the story life sucks and you are forever doomed no matter what so take responsibility even when people are giving you a hard time and treating you like dirt when it isn t your fault and they expect you to take the responsibility inspite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you plus norman osborn will prosper no matter what so you re doomed forever in the comics spider man also according to hitop films if you don t have a normal kids bedroom like spider man with cool nerdy posters everywhere you re not human not normal and a loser he said that in his spider man video essay,0
the spider man is in a lot of ways about a boy becoming a man he has to learn to take responsibility for his actions that s one of the things that i noticed when i first saw this movie at age was peter s transition from high school to getting a job while still trying to maintain his life and date the girl of his dreams even the scene where peter is figuring out his powers and he s exploring his new body where he s shooting sticky white fluid all over his bedroom and aunt may is like what are you doing in there hits close to home growing up as a teenager,0
jeremy forgot to include the link of the trailer in the description,1
this is definitely the movie i have seen the most of any movie i replayed this on the old vhs and dvd so much,0
love james franco love willem dafoe,0
he still looks drunk xdxdxd,0
i m still hoping that willem dafoe will be the joker one day,0
this movie still has a special place in my heart i love it,0
immediately hit this notification finally now review,0
hey jeremy do a review of all dead space series,0
i enjoyed aquaman but part of me didn t want willem dafoe to be in it even though he played the role well to me he will always be the green goblin,0
deliverance please,1
seems he ll finish the sam raimi spiderman movies before the back to the future movies lol,1
the og spidey i prefer toby s spidey over tom s any day miles morales is my second favorite spidey,1
i never heard of this movie you need to review more lesser known movies like this,0
can i just say jeremy really rocks this medium length swept back hair and full beard look he s a handsome man and a talented reviewer,0
love death robots review,0
so you saw my comment,0
give me reviews of spider man,0
you re pretty brave doing a video on spiderman without sony s consent,0
i clicked on this video faster then peter when he beat bonesawww,0
this was great can the world get your review of the demolition man please jeremy,0
if you are gonna review spiderman watch the cut much better,1
haha thought he looked great in the last video made me laugh a ton,0
no films have had a bigger impact on me as a person call them campy cheesy or goofy they are but fundamentally these movies are about morality choice and responsibility these films have so many examples of kindness and compassion and genuinely have encouraged me to be a better person,1
im spiderman guy now,0
bit late,0
review the darkman films,0
watching this movie when i was a kid in the movie theater was the best thing ever,0
yes finally,0
i never get tired of seeing the spider man but spider man is hands down my favorite superhero movie of all time,1
the thing that i love about sam raimi s spider man trilogy is that other than evil dead it s the only trilogy i can think of where not only is every installment amazing but each one was better than the last i don t care what anyone says spider man is of the greatest comic book movies ever made and not in an ironic way it s legitimately amazing,0
why does timeskip jeremy jahns looks like he s about to go dark knight rises mode and start working out like hell,1
jeremy please review hollow man underrated movie,0
the first spider man will always be the best one for me,0
i just finished money heist i loved it it s really good i recommend it,0
sorry but but fake,0
i m glad your doing fine you look handsome my guy,0
i missed the part where that s my problem,0
doctor strange should be really good if they let him do his own thing without too much interference it is disney so maybe not,0
ah rosie i love this boy,0
day of asking jeremy to review sam raimi s spiderman,1
my favourite movie,0
okay this was an unexpected but welcome surprise,0
i saw this movie in theaters when i was and for about ten years i always thought they were in college also did he take ap home economics or something how did he make a suit that good out of nowhere,0
the soundtrack to this film oozed early s,1
do a review of no country for old men,0
please have your gf cut your hair and just completely shave the beard jj,0
i m gonna put some dirt in your eye,0
going from saying he d shoot webs out of his butt then saying you were bummed out i see what you did there,0
there was a trailer that sony recalled because of the attacks,0
i recently rewatched the trilogy oh boy part felt bland boring except the third act when goblin was kicking spider man s culo,0
awesome can t wait for spider man,0
can you please review lord of war its super underrated even though its probably nicholas cage s best movie and it has a surprising ending that makes the audience really think about the world,1
avi arad just please give me a chance me what about spider man did you give it a chance did you,1
the first two raimi films are character drive dialogue driven films completely focused on the characters relationships and dynamics and conflicts and having all of it lead into the epic superhero stuff so many superhero movies these days are just cool action movies and really nothing more they re over saturated with too many characters too much action and just disposable sam raimi s spider man and spider man are not that they are to me genuine films with genuine acting genuine writing directing etc they will forever be one of the greatest adaptations of a comic book character ever,0
i love when trailers take the time to keep elements of a film secret or take time to make a bigger reveal as opposed to giving us a rundown on what the movie will be about like the matrix before that movie came out the trailers didn t reveal the concept of what the matrix was so you discovered it when you watched the film that s what makes me so excited for tenet,0

i m amazed i m buying it wow and for bucks can t beat that,1
uhm like literally every video game in existence you learn the bosses patterns to beat it tf kind of review is this,0
it s sad that they took a heavy downward turn with spiderman,0
the score should have been higher but it was refreshing seeing mary jane s original face,0
who s here in,1
when there was no ps and spider man nostalgic,0
you play as a man not a real spider,1
just finished the game its good,1
hit like if you felt uncomfortable watching this video,1
well i ve got a x box series x and i just purchased a ps pro to play all the exclusives of ps i have to admit that ps games are better i only used my ps pro now and x box series x i sleeping idle,0
played it for the first time this oct have atpn of backlog due to taking care of my infant for the past few years only getting a breather now that he is in kinder,0
i m only here to steal skin texture dlc mods to use for other spider man games,0
,1
this is really giving me the feels of spiderman,0
finished the main game time for dlc,0
ign really rated spider man at an which is lower than spider man ps despite saying that it was way better than the first one,1
so they said this was an out of ten low in my opinion but ok then they say that spider man improves on it in almost every way so at least a nine out of ten right wrong they ranked it an lower that the first game edit it got worse miles morales a smaller experience got a the f ign,1
take a shot everytime it says it makes you feel like spider man,0
spiderman better make my guy feel like spiderman or i m gonna lose it,1
after watching the review it made me feel like an ign reviewer,1
this guy is reptitive and lacks poise in his reviews get rid of him if you havent already,0
classic ign for me can t wait for spiderman,0
waiting on that spiderman review with symbiote spidey thumbnail,1
shut up mario is not better,0
the reviewer should quit ign for sure,1
ratio,0
it s a masterpiece,1
will you ever rate something,1
how much times ign said f e e l in this video alone times,1
only a min review and a score of shows ign true colors,0
one of the best game experiences i ve ever had was ps spiderman when you realized you could free web around the city for hours without being forced to go into your objectives glad that lived on here,0
this game is one of my favorites of all time,1
how does this effect lebrons legacy,1
jesus christ loves you all,1
spiderman has to shoot for,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,1
the biggest plot hole in the game is that avengers tower is literally visible in the final fight and the avengers do nothing to help with the massive plague outbreak or the fight against doc ock,0
mj was worse part of game in every way playing as her was worse of the worse,0
ok mins,0
is a joke this is one of the most fun games i ve ever played the combat and the swinging is so so much fun and smooth and the story is amazing,1
make you feel like spider man aside this is actually a terribly written review,1
things that make me feel like spider man,1
this game really makes me feel like my uncle died,1
based on how you guys rate shits you should have rated it,1
they did the meme right out the gate,1
playing as spiderman in spiderman makes you feel like spiderman,0

spider man ps got and miles morales got how they re both great games but the og is definitely better,1
pls bring the game to steam,0
your voice sounds alike holland,0
so according to these these people both tomb raider games are better than this,1

in an alternate universe j jonah jameson says send me feelings about spider man and the ign reviewers got him covered,1
this game is horrible,0
i m not entirely sure this game makes me feel like spiderman,0
insomniac rocks,0
jumping off a rooftop facing away from the camera and landing on hard pavement is full of the exaggerated depression of a new yorker in extreme debt,1
this review feels disingenuous,1
this game s combat system was a level above the arkham series,0
this game is a master pieace wrf ign,1
while playing this game for the very first time the remastered version on ps i m surprised to see they changed peter s face lol did someone complained about his face like what s the story behind that if anyone knows,1
the mj and mm sneak around missions are the worse the rest is great,1
learn how to articulate ideas in an original way you jackass,0
cant wait to play this game starting it now,1
this game deserves at least man,0
ps me kiyu gem stst nahi ho rahi hai,0
be the batman,0

ign reviews making me sick since,1
this game don t look years old,0
this rewiev makes me feel like spider man,0
this and batman arkham asylum are the best super hero games ever made,1
idk how you said miles morales is the best spider man game ever because this definitely is also the greatest superhero video game of all time right after batman arkham knight,0
marvel s spider man is very bad,0
this game is amazing and my favorite all time super hero game beside arkham knight,0
more like,0
this review captures exactly my own thoughts on the game amazing fun great story but repetitive side quests and relatively dull middle part,1
just know the actress who voice mj voiced black widow in marvel avengers tv show and telltale games batman catwomen,0
feel,0
could not disagree with the boss battles more that s the best part of the game,1
dead uncle simulator got an but cod ghost got,1
he is weak af normal goons takes him out so easily in this game it s frustrating trying to dodge fight and heal yourself simultaneously as bombs are being hurled at you and you re continuously facing a barrage of ammunition more frustrating than fun,0
not watched this yet usual avoid ign reviews as their so inconsistent,0
,0
excuse me,0
doom makes you feel like you re a doom,0
this game makes you feel like spider man,0
it really makes you feel like an ign journalist,0
made me really feel like spider man,1
had this game been named call of duty spiderman im sure they would ve have rated,1
how is someone so uncreative to last seconds without coming up with a better term or reaction,0
you can say it has a little something for everyone,0
sigh this game deserved much more than an,1
this game is so damn amazing love it just as much as the batman arkham games amazing story and gameplay for me,1
spiderman is lame batman s a badass,0

i think you shoulda at least give it a cuz this is def one of the best ps exclusive games not to mention how fun the game is without feeling too hard to beat,1
miles morales got a better score than this,0
there it is people,0
rebounds installed issues and wouldn t have been an option mentioned even before per ounces length dropped past long periods of timing format eclipsed painful lemon and otherwise amino acids are also an excellent choice exhorting member true most common is the most commonly known as their best,1
this is why i ve stopped watching ign reviews you can tell where they get their money from fortnite knobs,0
spiderman ps one the best game i ve ever played no doubt it s a masterpiece,1
looks spectacular but physics of movement are not quite polished yet,0
now they just need to release it for pc and or other platforms,0
ign it really makes you feeel like you wanna die,1
dunkeys review,0
forza has,0
ign smoking that pack i see,0
i just hated how the game forced me to play mj or miles and the dialogue can get so cheezy still a decent game a must play if you are a fan of spidy,1
this game made me feel like spider man but fortnite gets great job ign,1
he forgot to mention that this game makes you feel like spiderman,0
ll,0
an you can do way better ign this was the game of the year for some people,1
i guess that the game makes you feel like spider man,0
just finished this and it s a easy,0

ign doesn t know how to rate it should have been given wish it was on pc,0
it really makes you feel like spiderman,0
this review makes me f e e l like i m losing losing brain cells,1

this review made me feel like spider man,1
who is here after miles morales released,0

half of the review is just him telling how he felt like spiderman while playing this,0
spiderman avengers video game,0
fantastic game terrible reviewer,1
take a shot everytime he says he feels like spiderman,0
who s here after watching miles review,1
he basically says nothing bad about the game and it gets a,1
isn t a bad score but this game deserves at least a one of the best games of all time,1
will it be available on pc in near future any chance,0
dnajlion,0
this dude holds no nostalgia for the raimi spiderman vibe this game gave off similar to ps s spiderman games,0
for spider man ps and for angry birds star wars seriously ign spider man deserves a and angry birds star wars deserves a,0
im telling you now if you do the same thing for miles morales i will flip out spiderman did not deserve an out of it deserved a at least,1
in my opinion it should have gotten,1
i cant believe ign gave spiderman but a to last of us,0
how did this game get a it is at least a,0
the last of us part every call of duty or above fortnite doom alien isolation marvel s spiderman ign is officially a joke and should not be taken seriously,1
so fortnite gets a and this got an ign smokin crack fr,0
spider man ps is a you are wrong ign,1
i feel like spiderman miles moralas makes you feel like spiderman,0
wendys is fuckin nasty,1
makes you feel like spider man,0
at its core insomiac game s adventure makes you feel like spiderman,0
,1

this guy sounds like peter parker,0
ign should ve gave it a,0
this review made me feel like i should get a real job,0
feel like spider man be like spider man i am spider man,0
this game is a perfect ign are sellouts,0
who s here after they change the spider man remastered ps face,0
you guys are morons this is on my top ps exclusive list,0
who s here after the ps version came out,1
this feels underrated the connection you make to the characters the swinging the story and even the open world was done perfectly,1
if you have a ps and don t have this game why do you have a ps,1
this game iz not a,1
someone plz tell me should i buy this game,1
it deserves a,0
ign is rotten tomatoes of video games,0
how many times did you feel like spider man,0
i just got this game,1
i never want to forget how amazing this game was,1
the game deserves more than a i wondering if ign is runned by a year old since they gave tlou a and fartni i mean fortnite a,0
this game has to at least be a out of at least,1
i wanna punch ign right in the face,1
if you re playing spiderman ps for the first time do yourself a favor and turn the mini map off after the first hours or so thank me later,0
i ve never played this so i came here to influence my purchase decision why are the rest of you cry babies here,0
i hate ign,0
,1
tags the movie and not the game what the heck,0
i think best game ever,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
whos here for the year anniversary,1
this game got game of the year it deserves a,0
i think it makes you feel like spider man i might buy it,0
watching this in while eating kfc in arena centar cant wait to buy and play dlcs,0
this guy s voice honestly don t ever wanna hear a review from him ever again,1
lets face it everyone already has the game and just came here to chill,0
come on it deserves,0
the problem with ign is the fact that its multiple ppl doing sepate games in about a few days so they have daily uploads so for knife gets a and this masterpiece gets an,0
can anybody confirm if this game is going to be on ps i don t have a ps and i would like to play this with better fps and also have the opportunity to play next gen games,0
admit it you came here for,0
i m not feeling much like spider man today guys what about you,0
great review but i wish ign would drop the decimal places it just sounds weird and too precise when we all know how hard and imprecise it is to give games a score and it s sad a great review got so much anger for the which would have been mostly avoided if you just kept it simple and called it a,0
it makes you feel like spiderman boy i sure hope it does,0
i m not surprised if this guy becomes spiderman after playing this game,0
the fact that fortnite got a better rating than this made me feel like theres no longer hope in humanity,1
i m just here for the feel like spiderman thing xd for real now you re journalists you should have an extended vocabulary to use sinonyms comparisons and everything else to express an idea or opinion which is great,0
i caught that,0
this game puts the avengers beta to shame,1
this will go down as the best spider man game ever they actually nailed this game,0
for me personally this game dlc dlc dlc,1
i didn t feel like spiderman during this i was the spider man playing this,1
so what did the last of us ii get again,0
bgt,0
subscribe to my channel for new games,0
from ps spiderman not all the suits did not have any power that was ok liked mixed of the suits was in the game if going to be next spider man like to see miles morales get his first spiderman suit this like the one he was on now,0
looks like spiderman but redone and with new storyline,0
replaying main missions possible,0
this deserved a you just play on easy mode and don t do any of the side missions or unlock any of the suits,0
but did it make you feel like spider man ign i couldn t tell,0
review they didn t say really makes you feel like spider man enough,1
every ign comment section is like but fortnight gets a,0
yes feel the game feels like silk smooth and lush,0
it s not cod ign,1
but does it make you feel like spiderman,0
fortnite gets but this masterpiece of a game gets ign where do you get ur drugs,0
one word feel,1
ign spider man ps is lol hahahahah,0
this is the same guy that said spongebob rehydrated is too kid friendly,1
it s the best openworld game for me,0
the person who did the review is probably a xbox player,1
dude only this game is way better than it s about in my opinion but you can have your own opinion i guess,0
do you think he feels like spiderman when playing this,0
how many gigabytes is spider man ps though,0
it really makes you feel like your antman,1
man i really thought this game made me feel like spider man,1
no me gust como no me gust para nada,0
the fact that these games take so much effort to be made and then these fools rate it really low and rate fortnite is ridiculous,0
i didn t feel enough like spiderman,1
game name,0
playing as miles really makes me feel like spider man,0
better than the recent spiderman movies better than the recent mcu movies,0
cross between mgs and gta i personally think its brilliant and even better that it was on ps now,0
in my opinion it deserves out of,0
please please guys duck this review i finished spider man on ps now and it is a real the game cannot get better not just the story or missions everything in this game has its own surprises element which will leave u you speecless,0
,0
wow it s the same trash gaming journalist that gave tlou a and spongebob a,1
happy,0
seeing this review really makes me feel like an ign hater,0
hi,0
this game is at least a ign go home you re drunk as always,1
this game is,0
,0
spider man s mouth doesn t move when he talks,0
this game is really overrated the annoying and boring puzzles gave me a hard time,0
reviewer really did feel like spiderman for sure lol,0
so you give last of us a while this an,1
this video makes you fell like a ign reviewer,1
,1
at least a awesome gameplay,0
man the controls are so overwhelming,0
all the dislikes are from xbox players,1
whats better this or arkham city,1
but does it make me feel like spiderman,0
ign,1
this is probably the best incarnation of peter parker and a flawless spider man story yet it got a lower score than fortnite,1
hopefully it be come backward compatible with the ps,1
yes it s definitely the best game period but dude as a veteran why can t you just shoot octavious in the head game over,0
this makes me never trust ign again,1
they gave the last of us part ii a over this masterpiece,1
but does it make you feel like spider man tho,0
if u wonder why fortnite got a higher score it s cuz fortnite has plenty of content for a free game price matters for games rating,0
u nutz bro only,0
who is here after the ps reveal,1
this game is a ign serioisly wtf,0
for those of you who had it is it an enjoyable game,1
who s here after ps announced spiderman miles morales,0
who s here after the announcement of miles morales,1
funny how sabre international are acting like the police in america rn,1
is way too high you spend half the game not even playing as spiderman hiding behind boxes doing the same style missions over and over and over even when you are spiderman it s the definition of a generic repetitive button masher doing the same moves on the same enemies the only redeeming quality is the setting and swinging mechanics final score,0
combat is repetitive iam bored of this game,0
ign enemy bases can be really challenging me um you button mash and you don t utilize stealth to it s fullest extent of course you find them challenging jesus,1
i give a,0
this game is dope,0
spider man is one of my favorite superhero of all time he s perfect and the greatest,1

i guess this has a little something for everyone in a way that everyone feels like spider man,0
i really hate the combat in this game it feels too repetitive and crowded especially how you get dropped into the game and it goes like here s swarms of s of enemies have fun,0
don t really care about any other ratings from them but this game was a solid for me just finished it and eh wish some things could ve been more focused on like most the time when i walk around it s like im invisible might be a small detail to some but that ticks me off felt half assed the combat felt a little slow dont get me wrong it s a great game still but could ve been better,0
checked the reviewers profile done with the game and reviewed it like this wowwwwwwww,0
minecraft the game that really makes you feel like a cube,0

marvel s spider man is the best game i ve ever played and i have played a lot of games it is at least,0

those actors should play a irl spiderman movie,0
at least a,0
hold up this gets a while fortnite gets a goddammit ign you drunk correction,0
this game is one of the best games in the history of gaming,0
the game is great and is the best spiderman game with no doubt but change the spiderman character for batman put the game into the dark and you will have another chapter to arkham series with allmost all dark knight game mechanics the game should have name grand theft rocksteady studios,1

i love the animation of this game every detail is just perfect,1

im gonna put some dirts in ign reviewers eyes,0
this is a horrible review for one of the best superhero games of all time,0
this game is a at best very repetitive,1

this review really makes you feel like ign,1
looks like a childish game tbh not convinced to buy it,0
i mean feels like a fair rating considering it isn t flawless you cant just blatantly compare scores between games that are from different genres this game is a max,1
all the boss battles are too easy actually beating a bunch of silver soldiers is much harder than the boss battle,1
i just went back and played this again and i think i d still give it a you knew outta,0
,1
seriously amazing,0
too many webs,0
this game is,1
i was swinging through the city and the radio told me a crime was going on i kept going and said spiderman ain t got time for your problems,1
ign reviews you just scroll to comments to see the actual score,0
nobody really watches ign reviews they just came skip to the end score and if its lower higher than anything really they will whine about that,1
up the video game makes me feel like and old man,0
waist of money the biggest mistake in my life was buying this shitty game its for kids under i broke the disc after i played for minutes every thing about this game is awful,0
did jonah hill do this review on the behalf of ign,0
really it should be a at less,1
hands down one of the best video games ever great story line relatable characters excellent boss battles i could go on couple of unnecessary adds to the game but other than that i am very much looking forward to the sequel,1

alright this is an easy and you give it an best game of the decade honestly and it gets less than fortnite you need to fire the person who makes these,0

really this doesnt even deserve an such a waste utterly boring combats and gameplay plot was crap,0
can someone please show me the parts when he says feel like spider man,0
damn i just wanna go home and play this,0
watch out people it s a only ign s capabilities to review games lately has gone from weird to completely non sense wtf,0

fallout really makes me feel like i m in a post apocolyptic world,1
rumor has it he is still feeling it in,0
makes me feel like spider man ign,1
this game is a,0
now i want you to think about this for a moment mass effect andromeda got a but this game got an this review really makes me feel like a pissed off gamer,1
loved this game for the next one they should have more diverse and interesting side quests darker middle arc story and a more interesting soundtrack,0
how the actual hell did you rate fortnite better than this what drugs are you on,0
you can see he is playing in on easy difficulty tells everything you need to know,1
spiderman and mj all i hear is yosuke and rise,0
only,0
makes you feel like spidermam,0
i love bully,1
love the game except the mary jane missions,1
seconds ign,0
on the ps store looks tempting like,1
i d rate this game a if venom or one of the symbiotes was a boss battle,0
i lost all respect for ign when they gave fortnite,1
this dude actually sounds like peter parker wtf lol,1
i am getting this game for christmas in a few days hope its fun,0
the tmnt game really makes you feel like a turtle,1
spider man gets fortnite gets ign,1
this is up there with best game of the decade what you doing giving it an is a straight,0
wtf is wrong with ign this is not my word you should at least give the game a out of or out of you guys spend the whole video complimenting about this game and give it a,0
are you feeling it now mr krabs,0
my worst nightmare would be listening to a shades of grey audiobook read by this guy,0
wish this was on the switch but i m sure sony won t ever let that happen,1
i m on xbox now i literally brought ps for this one of my best experiences i had truly amazing great game in my opinion,1
guy remember that this got a lower score than advanced warfare don t trust this company,0
this game really makes you feel like spoderman,1
this spiderman game makes you feel like aunt may,0
this is a great game have loved playing it,0
out of right,0
just buy it nothing more to say,0
lego marvel superheroes got,0
best buy sell them for is it worth it,1
cool except for how they keep redrawing and changing the appearance of spiderman to some modern anorexic hipster who is tutoring an african american genius model give me a break i just bought a ps for this i hope in the sequel he changes his gender,0
the best spider man game ever made,0
i just bought it for and i can t wait i always wanted to buy it since release date but it was too expensive,0
this game shoud be rated not,1
made me feel like solomon grundy,0
is it easy to play or is it hard to play swinging or fighting etc,0
i would give it a and not just because its and i think it should be lower but other than that its amazing,1
id rate it it has its down sides,0
down voted cause it deserves at least or above,0
i felt like batman flying as spiderman,0
barkam asylum,0
now you can leave,1
noice,0
ima huge arkham knight fan and this game made me just as happy,0
great game but only issue for me was the boss fights its very front loaded and back loaded so middle of game had no boss bouts,1
for me of,1
i turned on th fan and i felt the wind in my face while swing ing,0
what you came for,1
and thus a meme was born,1
please spider man on the nintendo switch it will sell this game is already old on ps,0
my games i play ps are rdr far cry,0
spiderman is always be the greatest superhero all times playstation did a very wonderfull jobs make this game exclusive,1
every time this man says makes me feel like spider man a person is revealed to be adopted,1
they always have ads we already have painfully fake reviews and constant ads whats next,0
the first time i agree with ign on something overrated game in my opinion,0
i m sorry but this game definitely is a i could even say honestly ign wtf are you thinking,1
i will keep coming back and reminding people that spiderman is a solid very fun i beat it twice and will beat it again,1
nope your opinion is nitpicking and biased i win byebye,1
year later after playing the game this rating is none sense this game is a perfect,1
can u be greater at ur ratings ign,0
out of if you ask me,0
ign r u guys serious u should have at least given,0
i am reminded why i don t watch ign reviews anymore,0
lol everyone butthurt,0
but how does it make you feel,1
i came back here just to see if they change the ratings after spider man was nominated for goty award,0
should i buy it in,0
spiderman is most addictive game on ps,0
this game deserves a such a missed opportunity by ign to give spider man an amazing score,1
but is it the only place where u can get the thing,0
who is ign oh this is okay thanks dunkey,0
sometimes i just really hate ign,0
this made me feel like spider man,0
i always root for xbox but i have a ps and i loved this game what s wrong with me,0
it s not mario,0
for me it s a my only problem is that the amazing combat isn t utilized in boss fights,0
when it comes to superhero games the batman ones are still the best but that s just my opinion,0
an from the people who gave a to fortnite ok,1
wtf even is an a just give a and call a day instead of being a twat ign the story was amazing playing as miles and mj was an awesome twist even if it was for a few missions,0
only it seems that they are clearly not normal,0
i bet this really makes you feel like knack,0
just finished the game if anyone is considering buying this game please do its epic igns review makes me feel like hes smoking crack,0
if you want a comment that doesnt say make you feel like spider man here you go,0
just beat the game doesn t break new ground like arkham did and the inspiration from arkham is clear but damn this is a fun game and the story is a better spider man story than i ve seen recently,0
yeah no,0
just got done finishing this games story mode and most of the side missions and most of the little activities around the city and honestly this is the best game i ve played in years the story is so compelling and gets you drawn in all the side quests are fun and don t really get boring or repetitive just so much to say but i ll just simply give it a,0
hour adventure are we playing the same game lol,1
game is owesome many elements even d boss fights are straight taken from arkham games very arkham inspired game but a gr game with some new elements apart from arkham theme i loved this game though,0
great video,0
you are just nitpicking and biased i win byebye,0
it s on sale for should i get it,1
it make hate that spiderguy for this shity review for this game i m done with ign piss of,0
in the sequel they need to let you play different songs while you swing give spidey a ipod and let us choose from a playlist please,1
this is my fav game,0
the facts that you gave it a you lost all my respect smh,0
spider man fortnite unacceptable,1
this game makes me feel like spider man in his underwear,0
remember ign cant review games they have no idea what they are even saying,0
i mean at least a but should be way more,0
this game s a blast,0
this game is at least a i m sorry,0
i d rate it a solid out of myself,0
for those who are mad that this isn t a remember they gave fallout a higher score than the witcher,1
he sounds like jonah hill a little,0
you guys on drugs,0
but does it make you feel like ratchet,0
outside of the many bugs it s easily the greatest superhero game ever,0
,0
you have got to bee shit n me an a freakin really ign,0
seems like ign fought to cut points lol fing these mags are worse then are politicians,0
seconds,0
spiderman coming boys get ready,1
knack baybeeeee,0
i agree with you ign yes the web swinging makes you feel like spiderman and yes there s a lot of variety in the sidemissions but you have to admit the combat system is batman arkhamish and fluid it s really is a when you see it from ign s perspective,0
i ve gotta get this,0
spider man s trailer itself deserves a this game is phenomenal,1
if reddit could talk this would be its voice,0
it m a k e s y o u f e e l l i k e nothing,1
i dont have money,0
i really like it but it s not as fluid as the combat the arkham games,0
he didn t have all the map unlocked when the challenges are unlocked that is more then halfway through the game,0
it really makes you feel like batman,0
yup im getting this tomorrow,0
really,0
dude fortnite and this i feel like he didin t even complete the story mode,1
does it make you feel like batman oh wait wrong game,0
they gave for cod aw and for spider man ps wtf,0
i can tell u really feel like spider man during this game and it s amazing how u just feel like spiderman when u play this game that makes u feel like spiderman,0
remember ign thinks more highly of total war three kingdoms than marvels spiderman,1
the game truly makes you feel like spiderman would give it a as an overall rating the story is great and it s cool playing as peter parker amd spiderman,0
and they gave evolve a,1
i have an xbox i want a ps for this one game,1
aunt may dies in the end spoiler,0
made me feel like aquaman,1
this is how many times he said spiderman,1
boss battles arkham knight tank battles,0
make me feel like spiderman i don t think so this comment made me feel like making fun of you and then clicking the back button,0
ahem,1
this is a terrible review for a really fantastic game,0
such an enjoyable review to watch this guy need his own show,1
seconds ign it took you seconds to say that it makes you feel like spiderman,1
my only complain is that the game was too easy,0
i wish a comment on the game s tone was made no statement on the general writing either how kid friendly this game was kind of surprised me,0
you couldn t even go seconds without saying it makes you feel like spider man,1
is it worth im in dilemma,0
this deserved out of ign,0
awful game waste of time and money i dont want to play as mj or miles running past guards on a stealth mission apparently boss fights are too few and very repetitive absolutely gutted that this franchise has so much potential and they failed to deliver i dont know how anyone can rate this game above a,0
ign reviewing scores are a joke,0
really makes you feel like batman,0
,0
not voiced by tobey maguire,1
ok but is there fall damage,1
is this worth need to know,0
on playstation might cop,0
i have this game it is worth it,0
the suit is red,0
can t wait to get this for only today during sony s days of play sale,1
the reviewer is for sure a jameson fan,0
spider man kidnite stop smoking weed ign,1
hahahaha,0
played this game out of at least,1
call of duty ghosts isn t ranked higher than this wtf,0
ok so i made a fan made spiderman film it will premiere next thursday let me know what you think,0
i give this a,0
one of my favorite romantic storylines in a game ever i hardly disagree as many positive things you can say about this game the one critique i had about the story after playing the game was how underdeveloped the romantic storyline felt,1
ign has been saying makes you feel like spider man since the year check out the original ps n written review for spider man if you don t believe me,0
they couldn t even give the amazing spider man a review of amazing,0
video game dunkey brought me here,0
this game is what spidey fans needed it s the game that spidey fans deserved,1
that doesn t make sense,0
i must say a would be right i did have a few issues with the game the stealth was definitely it s weakest part the hand on combat was fantastic but stealth could definitely be improved but it s not bad more stealth takedown options would have been great for example when your on the side of a buiding with a enemy under you or when hanging opside down from down from sealing or other objects would be great,0
wheres the batmobile,0
is this game only on ps,0
they need to put the amazing spider man movie skin,0
i never i could expect such an epic story from a spider man game,1
why this final rating is so high no bonesaw no big wheel you gotta give it a zero,0
makes you feel like spider man rent,1
is it only me or is it normal to freak out every time you see stan lee,0
just finish this game and close to the platinum trophy so i came here just to say to igns score that for this very reason not many people take you guys serious any more obviously the guy reviewing the game had a blast and enjoyed it and so did i but then gives it a this game is at least a if not a very fun enjoyable with no flaws that i can think of truly a must play if you own a ps,1
this game is a solid,0
it deserves a or,1
delighted me nearly every second of its hours yeah first seconds of the video made me not buy the damn game,0
this was a pretty decent review by ign they are hit or miss honestly lol,0
really in my opinion it is a imo but i would be happy if u gave it but i was pissed,0
seconds baabyyyy,1
i loved this game but i think it would have looked way better on my xbox one x ps pro is just a weak system games on my one x look so much better glad i own both so when i have to make a choice i can choose the best version which is always on my one x,0
rdr makes you feel like boah,0
you give red dead redemption a even thoughts its buggy and after the campaign is boring but spiderman is a you never get bored plus it is a exclusive to ps like c mon the city is great,1
feeling like spiderman would mean you would have extreme motion sickness all the time,0
this game got a lower score than new super mario bros u ign what are you smoking,1
this game looks amazing but why did it have to be an exclusive dammit i just so happen to have every modern console plus a pc except for the ps and this is the one console they release it on,0
too fooken damn short,0
if you wanna hear it,0
just got back into gaming recently decided to buy a ps that came with the new spider man game it s a great game i m crap at the web swinging i m half way through the game i m loving it,1
wish days gone was this polished,0
it deserves better,0
i like how this game makes me feel like spiderman,1
wow,1
i think the rating was fair could it have been a oh for sure but playing it for hours with the dlc and collectibles and everything else in the game hes right the combat did get repetitive and monotanous at times with boss battles feeling like a watered down version of the one before it amazing storyline game mechanics are awesome in this game but the combat while fun and enjoyable could use some tweaking especially in the smaller boss battles,0
ign its not on pc and xbox one,1
please release this spider man on the nintendo switch it will sell,0
it makes you feel like spider man,0
it s telling of ign that a hot mess like arkham knight would get a but a masterpiece like spider man ps would get an,1
this is the only game i ever and i m replaying it,1
if this is not any part of the mcu why is the stark suit and avengers music in the game,0
spider man ps review its great the best ps exclusive the end,0
,0
ign you called it this game has an on metacritic and it s user score on metacritic is exactly,0
last spiderman game i actually enjoyed was at ps didn t change with this one i expect a lot from my games,0
for pc,0
are you feeling like spider man now mr krabs,0
still mad at you ign for not giving it a,0
too much spider not enough man ign,0
too many men not enough spiders,0
when the best superhero game is not the highest rated spider man game can ign be trusted,0
i definitely want to start my foray in the ps virtual world with this game,0
idk but an rating seems short for this game,0
i need part for this game,0
haha ign you put wrong you forgot to take out the period,1
this deserved a nine at least,0
makes you fee like batman,0
this video makes me feel like spider man,0
ign is trash sub to gameranx,0
does this game make you feel like spiderman,0
no venom,1
how to download in redmi a,0
i play spider man,0
this video makes you feel like batman,0
too much spider not enough man ign,0
amazing it got an which is a very high score but people are still bitching and moaning about the score,0
,0
you taking the piss this game was the best game of,1
lot of people whining in the comments but this game got a well deserved although i think an would be fair honestly the reviewer failed to mention how janky the game gets at times it messes up the flow and makes you aware you re playing a video game inputs not being read properly equaling strange movements or taking unnecessary damage i think they tried to replicate the arkham series which were all s under rocksteady but came up short it s a great game but not a masterpiece,1
how can i get miles on this,0
make you feel like spiderman,0
this one reminds me of spider man web of shadows,0
this game was amazing hands down not just one the best superhero games ever but its one the best games on ps without a doubt when sony said that greatness awaits when the ps first released they meant it,1
spider man should be,0
it deserves a higher score,0
what a nerd just give it a or at least a flat you guys are so weird when it comes to rating games this game is the spider man game show some respect,0
more like,1
i have a spiderman avatar for ps to give away if anyone is interested,0
moved the puddle from the demo,0
yeah yeah but does it make you feel like batman,0
combat is a blast side quests are like part of the story webswinging feels amazing gadgets are super fun to use makes you feel like spiderman lets give it an,1
any crying xbox or pc gamers here well i am an xbox gamer and every day i regret buying that gameless console exclusives,1
i love this game soooooo much,1
honestly the stupidity of this review is unlimited the game clearly deserves a for it has an incredible story amazing combat many suits to customize spidey many gadgets to use to create powerful combos awesome graphics and also it makes you feel like spidey it is the best spiderman game compared easily to spiderman insomniac did an incredible job with the game and you should respect it,0
the worst score ign you are garbage this game is,1
maybe if the reviewer felt more like spider man his rating would have been higher,0
i really just want to feel like big wheel now,0
too much web slinging,0
i m not a big gamer but once i found this game i cant stop playing,0
this game is one of the best,0
such an amazing game cannot wait for the sequel,1
ign too much peter not enough parker,0
at most a imho story is bad close up graphic is bad sky line great ui is bad glad some folks like it but don t compare it the the real masterpieces out there,1
masterpiece game,1
i could enjoy just swinging around the city without completing task since of kids that is all they do anyway would be nice to do it swinging from roof tops,1
this guy sounds like videogamedunkey,0
ign wtf this game is a masterpiece so ashamed we all know that your biases to every game that s not call of duty,0
insomniac needs to remake matrix the path of neo hands down,1
spider man was my game of so much more fun than gow and rdr which was totally unexpected,1
not on xbox one,0
,1
remake maximum carnage,0
i m planning on buying this soon is this better than spiderman,0
feel counter x,0
makes you feel like spiderman,1
cool,1
to much webs,0
so apparently fortnite is better than this what are they smoking over at ign,1
always finding nano sized problems to heavily emphasise on,0
i should ve been in this game,0
it gets redundant playing as mary jane that brings the score down to,0
spiderman is a masterpice,1
ign hey we need you to review spiderman john im really feeeling it,1
didn t make me feel like spider man it made me feel like batman,1
check out my new gaming channel about spider man,0
used to play spiderman original on the original xbox xd loved swinging about for no reason,0
this game is not a you rated cuphead a and that was because it was too hard this is better than cuphead in my opinion,0
let s see what marvel spider man would look like,0
this game is better than the other spider man games i ve played but it s still mediocre in terms of fun and immersion,0
the making of a meme,0
wait i still felt like batman should i see doctors is it serious i m shaking here,0
i m the only one who wants a watchmen game not by insomniac though that would be cool and i wouldn t mind but rather the guys that made the arkham games just imagine being dr manhattan,0
call me crazy i deleted the game from my console cause they deleted the freedom tower,0
,0
seconds until feel like spiderman,1
this was more than a it was a ign y all need to lay off the drugs,1
opinion p nj n noun a view or judgement formed about something not necessarily based on fact or knowledge that in my opinion is right,0
this game is a top must have ps game,0
reviewers shouldn t talk about difficulty without disclosing the difficulty they played or playing on the higher levels this certainly isn t a hard game but i find how the reviewer played important to the review,1
just finished it was great i give it a,0
did you actually bother to play the game,0
game of the year for sure,1
,0
wow,0
cries in xbox,0
ok just saying spider man s strength is lifting about ten tons so the comics say so why can the brutes still block his attack i know the comics say he pull his punches on normal people but damn at the same time it does make it more challenging i m confused someone help me please,0
m a k e y o u f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
you just said it makes you feel like spider man so why not give it a out of when the next spider man game comes out and you review it you better give that game a out of this spider man game as you stated makes you feel like spider man so it makes no sense or what so ever to give that game an out of seriously the cities and the quality of the graphics are next level this game ign should be s out of,0
spiderman gets but fortnite gets ign were you on crack or what,1
s,0
how did you played it days before launch,0
this game looks like a lot of fun i guess i m gonna have to buy it judging from the comment section an awful lot players feel this game is even better than this video says,0
i got this game for christmas and i want to play it soo bad but i am dedicated to finishing the prequel book first hopefully i can knock that book down soon so i can try this game for my self,0
spider man deserves at least,0
f e e l,0
f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,1

,0
buy the game here,0
i mean it can hardly get better so why not a at least,0
when i was little i always think i m spiderman by putting duck tape on me and tryed to climb walls,0
how to do verification,0
coupled with gameplay that makes you feel like spider man,0
the score should at least be,0
who wants to be spider man,0
one of the greatest spider man games that i ve played so far i m also glad that they made the spider man character more of a cross combination between tobey maguire and andrew garfield because i m not really a fan of tom holland s version,1
this games great the only problem i had with it is that if you re a completionist then it can be a bit of a grind,0
ign too much spider not much man,1
only h adventure,1
yeet yeet yeet,0
call of duty black ops got a higher rating let that sink in,0
i thought it was hours,0
should ve gotten a,1
just remember cod got a,0
the real review is in the comments,0
dude this new spiderman ps game is totally awesome,0
i disliked the vid cause i felt they should have gave it a higher score like a or,0
why isn t this,0
but really spiderman does make you feel like a cowboy,0
ea single player games are dead oh how the mighty have fallen,0
i just got this game for christmas i don t do super heroes i came here to find out how this game plays and whether or not i may enjoy it or am i better off trading it in all i got out of my six min spent on your video is you filating spiderman this is completely vapid and devoid of any real substance i dont think you understand the role of a review,0

marvel s spider man fartnite,0
wait what do you feel like,0
the spider man on the back cover of at least one few copies of this game appear to be the same body structure as spider woman although the body structure of all people can and should be better and does not need to be any particular bodily structure for anyone it s their body,0
really makes you feel like batman,0
ign too many miles not enough uncle ben,0
ign too many marvel not enough naruto,0
ign too many web not enough swinging,0

i think mr krabs is feeling it now,0
ign majority of gamers no raimi suit,0
i hope silver lining is not the last update for this game,0
my rating of this game it s over,0
this game made me realize how underrated spiderman is considered compared to mcu hero s also the best spiderman and peter parker ever better than any game,1
this game gets a from me,0
who the hell would watch this review these people are total sell outs,0
this game is for me don t remember last time when i had this much fun fighting kingpin s men against overwhelming number of thugs with guns rocket launchers etc is super fun you have to master your art otherwise you will keep dying that needs improvisation the main story and side missions all are superb can t put my controller down,1
can anyone explain the feel jokes,0
xbox is better,0
i already want marvel s spider man,0
even he has a hard time with the pun,1
the swinging is pretty kool but i dont think the game is that great tries to be arkham without being arkham,0
feels like it ripped off arkham asylum,0
this game made me feel like a couch potato playing a spider man video game,0
one of the best superhero game ever really love this masterpiece,1
one con of the game your jump ability is locked until you unlock prior lockables i m a fair spidey when it comes to open world games but i did not like the fact you have to unlock his natural jumping ability,0
but the rating in the trailer said,0
better than the newest spider man movie not saying the movie was bad at all this game was just that much fun,0
kool,0
my game crashed toward the end of the prison break mission then i restarted it had to play through that all over again now i m at the part with all those homing missiles stuff flying at you like every seconds,0
imagine this game but on a xbox one x k fps edited oops i ment to say fps,0
just for the iam unsubscribing are you fuckin kidding the game is a,0
the game is amazing but not better than arkham games the problem the game had was glitches,0
this review needs more dislikes,0
how is no one talking about the beginning where it sounded like he was yelling spiderman,0
,0
ign they wouldn t have denied you some money if you had asked insomiac,0
this game is a masterpiece,1
i have an xbox one and a nintendo switch the second i heard this game was going to be released on ps i have to say i was extremely envious however i bought it today and i m getting a ps for christmas can t wait,0
did he say hour adventure not but,1
it is better than you think,0
the graphics make you feel like you are playing on pc,0
to much webs not much spiderman,0
combat system seems trash no go for me,0
really i give it a that game was just brilliant,1
love seeing you two together again you always were my favorites,1
this deserves a but not gonna argue with ign since it makes you feel spider man,1
most nitpicky review i ve ever seen,0
the game came in a bundle with my ps and i honestly didn t know much about it nor cared when i first got it now i m so addicted to playing and continuing the story,1
the best spiderman and game of the year,1
this game is a hands up,1
i would give it a ten though,0
and the doctor octopus final battle is one of the best ever video game console,0
the web swinging is perfect learning the fight system has a curve but wants enough practice has been put in you can be unstoppable especially with jacked up gadgets,1
i mean its nice and all but does it make you feel like spiderman,0
my favorite game i have played this year d,0
this video made me feel like the dark souls of ign watchers,1
is it an or a decide ign decide,0
just passing through,0
ign too much spider to little puddles,0
front and back loaded ok now you guys are just throwing around words,0
red dead vs spiderman,1
is any one else bothered by the swinging webs not sticking around a bit longer it adds to the realism of course they disintegrate even in the comics but it s hard to believe webs that can support a grown man swing on top of being as strong as a tension cable and disappear a second after jumping off the web hate to be that guy but spider man game had that,0
too much combat,0
can you ride vechiles on the street level,0
doesn t make me feel like spider man enoouggh,0
i wonder how this game would be with ps vr,1
i have one word for this game nostalgia,0
just got it for black friday and am loving it awesome game,0
and so jonathon dornbush will forever be known as the guy who really wanted to feel like spiderman,1
yeah yeah yeah but does it make you feel like batman,0
seconds ign you really took seconds to say feel like spiderman this may be a new record bois,0
at its core this game made it feel like spider man marvels spider man made me really feel like spider man,1
sorry red dead redemption and any game i have waited for far cry but spider man takes goty for me,1
i loved the game but this time ign is right the game is an for being short and a bit repetitive regarding side missions and graphics look blurry from a distance breaking the immersion sometimes my personal score is anything above but not quite a,0
this game takes week to fully complete it should not be awarded an,0
this review is so bland makes you feel like spiderman come on dude step it up,0
spiderman friend zoing mj hmmmm,0
video game reviews are no longer allowed to say make me feel like,1
this game is probably closer to a for me almost damn perfect,0
what about assassin spidy,0
ign not enough dying uncles,0
guys guys i need help so basically i accidently deleted my safe file for this game how do i restore it please someone help me,0
sony should not own rights to spider man the story alone was better then the previous movies and i can argue better then the avengers spinoff sony please give it back to marvel and let the spider be great,0
i ve never liked superhero movies but this game looks really enticing it s currently on sale for me is it worth it,0
not batman,1
can you buy other games to play on this spider man ps,0
spiderman makes you feel like batman,0
is the limited edition console still on sale,0
the game deserve maximum all people say its or i think they are fan for spider man so they support the game no matter what the reason but the fight no fun in this game its just like do the same fight agian and agian,0
i wish they would make red dead redemption already and when the hell will rise of the tomb raider come out finally uncharted will come out january,0
the ship spawned in,0
i disliked this review why because this review made me feel too much like i had something better to do,1
i liked this game but i enjoyed spiderman better your map is just ny which is cool but s you could go in subways and sewers still a great game,0
make a new review please ign go play it by yourself and finish it by yourself i finished the game two times with a ng and i am telling you this game deserves,1
make me feel like spider man daddy,0
whos here voting spider man ps game of the year i am,0
still not sold with this i want to play before i buy and idk why but the shitty non reflection of spidey is altering my choice every video i ve seen has no reflection of him swinging on surrounding buildings or even when hes on a building,0
i just finished the entire game how did it not get a out of,1
how are you gonna give spider man an and give destiny s forsaken dlc a which is basically the same thing as the other stuff destiny releases ign is now officially irrelevant when it comes to game score,0
,0
i got this game wiht gram weed i am so blessed,0
spiderman batman but i do enjoy the stealth in both games more of that just wish there was a better villain than li,0
the one question is does this game make you feel like batman,0

for this game shut up ign,0
does this make you feel like sideman,0
,0
i going to ignore you,1
ok time for a daredevil and punisher game with an m rating,0
i feel like the only complaints that we make about this game are simply those that keep it from being perfect i think the score is low and deserves a to,0
this is definitely a,1
do you watch dunker videos,0
i have the game and me personally i think the game is all hyped the game play is so repetitive the boss fights aren t bad all the extra side missions aren t that bad to me it s a hopefully the second spider man game brings alot more things to the franchise,0
all day long,0
batman arkham is still better,0
really this game is one of the easiest s ever,0
how did you give ratchet and clank a crack in time a better review than this,0
in my opinion it deserved at least a,0
spiderman ps review mild spoilers,0
this is the only review that i actually agree with you on,0
ign will give spider man an but give every cod a what a joke,1
no green goblin or venom boss fight,0
if u smoke play this game high it s amazing,1
st game i wanna finish in years this game is special and will be remembered for a long time to come,1
this just feels like another assassins creed to me,0
,0
has anyone tried playing this with a keyboard and mouse if the gameplay is smooth with mouse and keyboard i will buy a ps please help me know anyone,0
feel feel feel feel feel feel,0
but does it really make you feel like spider man,0
dat frame rate doe terrible,1
is it worth buying i really like superhero themed stuff and freeroam games with great stories,1
batman arkham knight assassins creed origins farcry assassins creed odessey spiderman ps are you guys dumb,0
the game might be a bit repetitive but honestly what fun game isn t at time the visuals and the near flawless web swinging was worth the i loved having to find all the backpacks and landmarks i m only into the game and already i m glad i chose this over bo can t wait to continue my adventure,0
ign to much spider man,0
i feel like spider man,0

review by j johna jameson,0
sike the game is ign smoking something else,0
this game is fuckin awesome the combat is badass the story was amazing i love the addition of other villains and heros i didn t expect to see this game to me is a full it s up there along side with uncharted and fallout new vegas,1
u must be high when did this review because this game should be at least or,1
wow i put the controller down many years ago but as a devout spider man gamer growing up this makes me want to run to the store grab a console and get this game,1
is buying a ps just for this,0
spiderman is easily a,0
imo i give it a but only because the side missions are repetitive and ing the game is tedious felt like going insane chasing crime events over and over again at least j jonah jameson s audios make it more bare able,1
too much man not enough spider ign,0
man some of these comments are just whiny waah it should be a its points off of being a what difference does points make,1
wait this masterpeice gets an but odassy gets a,0
feel like spider man feel like spider man feel like spider man,0
i love how nobody is feeling the same way about the game as ign does for me it s,1
i dunno ign this game made me feel like superman,0
i can definitely feel it now,0
spiderman voice actor is the same actor who voiced sasuke in naruto dub,0
not enough batman,0
definitely,0
assassin s creed odyess tho has a better rating wtf,1
made me feel like pizza parker,1
ur not my boss this is for me xddd,0
marvel s spiderman makes you feel like batman,1
i d give it a,0
really come on should be a at least,0
can t wait to play,0
it doesn t make you feel like mj,0
i bet this reviewer s favorite smash bros character is shulk because he s really feelin it,1
dunkey,1
ign though that removing pros cons in their review will prevent the new meme from born big mistake,0
alright i have something to say using an emulator to play the game for free is illegal right btw they re a pc player and they re playing the game in their pc,0
for me it was,0
saw the dunkey video came here for the comments was not disappointed,0
i really don t get why this game isn t on xbox one i would really love to play this,0
not a big enough bulge,0
bet ya he didn t do the secret suit,0
people who say dont do a fight for xbox or ps this is the reason for i am going to purchase ps pro,0
m a k e y o u f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
are you feeling it now mr krabs,0
how did you determine the did you just feel like rating it that,0
madden spiderman ps is ign on some weed right now they think madden is better then this game,0
i d like a second review seriously how is this not a or higher it has to be better than this years madden which is rated i mean come on,1
the fact that cod ghosts got an from ign and this got an makes me feel disgusted,1
a its longer than hrs way longer b story was incredible c this is the most fun game i ve played in the past years fantastic game,0
i just got this game yesterday and im not a spiderman fan so im just playing this because i love video games and the thing that has struck me so far is that this feels way way too much like the batman games so much so that i dont feel like im playing a different game im not enjoying the combat to much because the controls feel way over complicated like it seems like they tried t change buttons around that usually are now for being used for certain things just so it doesn t feel to similar to other games but its just way to obvious and annoying the webslinging is ok doesnt feel smooth yet and so im not that into it but problem is its just too much like other games ive already played in this same setting batman prototype series especially so im finding it hard to get the motivation to even play cause i feel like im burned out on these games but i kinda wanna play cause i like open world games so its tough im actually enjoying playing graveyard keeper more right now then spiderman and i think its partly because im not a spiderma fan or marvel fan but it seems like for u fans of spidey u finally have a decent enough game for you guys,0
easy there cornbush,0
too much spider webs,0
not call of duty so,1
this game is easily a solid best spiderman game no best superhero game ever,0
but does it make you feel like batman,0
then why do i constantly want to snap my controller in half whilst playing this game,0
i m sorry but this game felt so easy to me i played on spectacular and the boss battles went so quick and i platinumed it within days it s fun but it feels like it s missing something the game felt incomplete but i can t quite place it that being said it was a total blast,0
i ll give this a,1
why should i believe this review at all when you guys have given shadow of the tomb raider a higher score,1
bruh u gived assassin s creed odyssey a better score the fuckery is real with y all,0
ok so does it or does it not make you feel like spiderman dude,0
you gave spider man an but assassin s creed origins a and odyssey a ign spider man is a spectacular i m not sure i feel that you know how to do game reviews,1
this review really makes you feeel like ign and it s a shitty feeling,1
i can t wait for final fantasy vii remake to make me feel like a final fantasy,1
it really makes you feel like spider man,0
i have no words best spider man game ever made i ve played every game released till now and marvel spiderman is the one that made me feel i was playing a classic well made and badass spidey game out of,1
well it s my time to save for a ps,0
dont forget these are the people who gave evolve a,1
this deserves,1
can you drive cars in this game,1
i can t feel like spider man watching this video,0
the cars and people on the ground look like they re from a ps game,0
whitch one should i buy like black ops comment spider man i cant deside,0
why don t ign reviews mention more cons they almost always just praise the game throughout their reviews and boom a score lower than you thought it was going to get it s so inconsistent,0
ign theirs this thing called rounding here i ll help you if it s under you round down if it s or over round up understand,0
this game gets a from me,0
i m psyched for this game want to make money playing video games,0
but you gave evolve a,1
basically ign try to review for everyone who likes and dislikes spider man games but if u love spider man or any hero games this is a,0
out of too much web,0
i would give marvel s spider man a rating the story was excellent as well as the side missions but the challenges became repetitive after a while although i liked how insomniac games made each challenge have a different variety to them other than that the game is near perfect web slinging combat and a great open world makes spider man a great experience,0
the game is perfect its a,1
you should ve gave it a,1
i just watched amazing spider man review before this,0
ever notice the best spidey games have dock ock in it like spider man spider man edge of time and last spider man ps,0
ign is so biased toward activision and big developers,1
this game is a masterpiece and deserves a rating,1
according to ign this game is worse than evolve,1
cough forza horizon cough,0
it makes you feel like you re watching an ign review,1

the reviewer secretly hates marvel and spiderman as a character is ridiculous,1
so jealous xbox owner,0
ign please feel free to slap yo self for giving this rating this game is an easy shame,0
yo qte s are hated across the board but i think they were dope in this game,0
the voice actor for doc ock is the same as rigby from regular show,0
oh come on give it a,0
call of duty ghosts got higher than this,0
the mary jane sections make you feel like dying,1
idk i didn t really feel like batman i give it a there s some kind of spider dude in it,0
you should have talked more about how it makes you feel like spiderman,1
i cant stop playing it,0
ign always supporting xbox,1
people still watching this ign crap well i guess you guys don t know about angry joe,0
i really enjoyed the boss battles,0
amazon has a spider man if you don t believe click in link to know,0
but does this game make you feeeeeel like spider man,0
decent review but i wonder how many hours you played hours,0
you better have completed the game in around hours,0
i like the batman arkham knight more tbh,0
who else thinks it deserves a,1
will this ever come to pc,1
wait for it waait forr it strives to make you feel like spiderman,0
for those of you that did t know there is another mid air trick that people have been talking about lately and it was seen in some of the game tutorials as well it is the diving corkscrew you need to find a real tall building preferably charge your jump for additional height and do not force into a swan dive by pressing l just wait until you transition into it by simply falling down from there hold your left thumbstick either left or right and then additionally press and hold circle and triangle together i think it s pretty neat as it adds to the existing moves however i also think that insomniac could have removed one of the flying helix tricks and replace it with something different maybe even looking into using the diagonals but that s just me,0
lmao ign not being fair enough this game deserves a complete everything about it its just amazing,0
kurapika would love this,0
why is spiderman agelimit,0
next make an open world venom game,1
how come no one is reviewing the game on the xbox one,0
batman do you bleed ign,0
are you feeling it now ign,0
they rate fornite higher than this masterpiece,0
mr stark i i d dont feeeel like spiderman,0
pokemon lets go pikachu and eeeve make you feel like pikachu and eeeve,0
the verdict made me feel like green goblin,1
ign gives super mario odyssey a also ign gives destiny forsaken a still ign gives spider man a we are the dumbest civilisation ever,1
only an you ve lost your mind,1
feel,0
hey dunkey it made me feel like spiderman,0
buy it or not,0
you sound like oswald cobblepot in the gotham series,0
this game at least deserve a,0
all these comments saying the same thing really makes you feel like spider man,0
is this game age appropriate,0
,0
i didn t realize xbox one doesn t have access to the game y all are missing out for real lmao,0
peter parker spider man,1
great game almost done with it but i feel like the game has no reply value,0
destiny forsaken spiderman ps,0
ign can t play as batman ummmmm,0
been playing the game and for some reason in the cutscenes the characters have purple eyes this started during the scene with osborns campaign does anyone know how to fix it,0
i hate it when spiderman games make me feel like spiderman,1
actually angers me that it s not at least a,1
seriously ign this game deserve like if you agree,1
best spiderman game since spiderman i have to say,0
dunkey,0

do you feel it now mr krabs,1
great game but also an overrated game,1
this game makes you feel like papa john,0
hahaha only you suckers,0
nhl got tho lmao what a joke,0
finally a new better awesome spider man game and also web of shadows and the spider man movie game for the wins,0
i haven t heard one single bad thing about this game,0
but how does spider man feel tho,0
and now the most important question of all which tower is higher the freedom tower or the avengers tower,0
they give destiny s money grabbin dlc a higher rating than this game wow ooooooh kaaaay,1
just bought it now gotta wait for it download lol,0
the swinging is boring you cant charge jump off ledges and its hard to webzip cause of the short distance of how the web goes i can name other things if you think this game is overrated like or comment but it does look great on graphics ill give it that,0
i think he said feel times,0
just finished it amazig game if you have a ps you need it,0
too many buildings,0
wait insomniac like from ratchet and clank,1
game of the year perfect game,1
its a great game but there is a reason i sold it after finishing it,0
let s all just take in the fact that ign gave this game a while they gave destiny forsaken a,1
they should of tested the game,0
lol what a joke of a company,0
at least a,1
insomniac didn t cut a check,0
i never fought the rhino or whoever that flying guy is i can t remember his name just watching this video and saw that cutscene i definitely didn t do that and also i was pretty sure i was going to end up fighting doctor octopus i don t think i d beat the story yet i took down the chinese guy i can t remember what his name was my memory is horrible is that the end of the game i don t think it is cuz i just got a mission called breakthrough can someone tell me what the last mission is called,0
i picked up tomb raider instead i m sure spider man is fun but in terms of open world exploration i m more stoked about just cause bring on the explosions,0
this games story is so ballsy but i never doubted it once when something different came up that was a turn from the lore i never once went wait what,0
it really make me feel like spider the man,0
this game is a nearly flawless masterpiece i highly recommend it of,1
best spider man game ever if you re still on the fence i did a spoiler free in depth review on my channel others have enjoyed it maybe you will too,1
plzz need a goddam sequal,0
it s batman but with spiderman yaaaaawn,0
you f e e l the pressence of the it makes you f e e l like spider man comments it fills you with determination to kill ign oh noes a undertale refrence now you want to kill me,0
buzzfeed,1
is it only hours,0
,0
too little spiders,1
i don t know why everyone is getting orgasm from this game i mean it s really beautiful and nice etc but it puts in almost directly into the action you have no idea what you are doing even if they show you some controls for couple of seconds you just have no idea how it works and they force you to keep fighting very frustrating from the start as a plus i have no idea what is the story about and who is that lady talking to me on radio and why enemies keep attacking you like you would piece of garbage this is really weird it s like go to the cinema in the middle of a movie it deserves high score but gosh not from,0
un treh,0
lol its a at least and i know games better than this guy,1
this review makes you feel like ign,1
really makes you feeeeeeeeel like spiderman,0
ok be honest did anyone else cry at the end with i m talking about the aunt may scene,1
this game has so much bugs it isn t even funny you can tell they got lazy sometimes,0
definitely the best since spiderman i can t decide which is better though,0
im pretty sure thats oscorp and not avengers tower,0
you lasted seconds you lasted seconds to make you f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
supa mario brudas twoooo baybbeeeeee hahaaaaaa game of da year ez no doubt,0
objectively i think the game is probably about what ign said or a nine overall i have a few different opinions i disliked taskmasters challenges and loved the stuff ign railed on just after that but overall i agree however subjectively i d give it a just because of one little thing cystic fibrosis it s a somewhat rare medical condition that i have and this was the first time i ve ever heard it mentioned in a video game honestly i m very touched by the representation,0
spiderman ps ww internalized screaming also batman arkham knight,0
m a k e s y o u f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
if this game is a then i am obama,1
i got an xbox one for halo and forza motorsport and horizon i can t afford a ps but i don t think this is worth getting one for anyway,0
spiderman was phenomenal but for some reason i don t think i ll buy this,0
okay but you feel like spiderman,0
game of the year,0
because lack of pizza time,0
really the game is amazing ign should ve at least gave spiderman a,0
thousand thumbs down xbox one x users confirmed,0
that side mission where there s that dude is hanging with some criminals and you have to chase em with your webs is reallyyy fun and i don t know why i loved it,1

i think insomniac is one of the best studios in the game i d put them up there with playground games the coalition insomniac s sunset overdrive is a masterpiece and this spider man game moves very very similar to sunset overdrive along with the wide open world and the fighting,0
they gave this game a lower score then evolve,1
batman arkham knight puts it to shame in detail and story and combat,1
all these feeelingsssss i feel them,1
this review makes me feel like ign,1

idk if i should buy spider man or shadow of the tomb raider first can someone help me make my mind up,0
this game made me feel insomniac,0
,0
it would pretty awesome if we can go inside every building of the game,0
the real question should be does it make you feel like a soyboy,1
there it is ladies and gentlemen,0
did anyone even look at this script before mindlessly reading it off,0
this game deserves a,0
hey ign how come spiderman ps scores fell a bit under the belt of shadow of tomb raider with so much creative elements favoring the spidey game,0
see this is an issue when you have a huge team of reviewers a lot of reviewers will be like eh it was okay i enjoyed it but only in a very generic way it had a few bugs and was nothing special then you have another guy it delivered on everything i was hoping for and was a spectacular time i feel like a lot of reviewers are measuring games on a truly universal scale while some are measuring games against their own favorite games like this guy,0
omg so realistic,0
this review really makes you feel like spider man,1
m a k e s y o u f e e e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0

where s martha,1
watching this makes you feel like you re watching a spider man review,1
meu esse game sim foi um sucesso parece que estamos jogando um filme podia todos os games ter esses gr ficos de filme sensasional,0
f e e l,1
when aunt may died at the end was the saddest thing ever i rarely tear up in games but that bit pulled at my heart strings hard specially when she revealed she knew he was spidey all along heartbreaking great game,1
when will it be on xbox one is my only question,0
at its core is mandatory in the script for ign reviews,0
well done you just earned a like,0
just beat the game i think it deserves,0
spider man spider man makes you feel like spider man,1
this makes me feel like a puddle,1
why d i buy an xbox,0
you fight to boss at the same time,1
ign should make a video about the hidden photoes i mean the story behind them,0
i think you mean,1
honestly the only game i ve been excited for in the past years ive been an xbox player since a child but bought a ps just for this game,0
this game made me really feel like donkey kong,0
,0
feel like i went through this game too fast as already platinum it and now just wanting on the dlc great game though for sure,0
make an aquaman game next with a megladon in the ocean,0
haha i love that they avoided showing the huge spoiler but alluded to it or should i say him when they talked about peter s mentor,0
insomniac please make an iron man game like this,0
sorry xbox x time to fire up and dust off the ole og ps this spider man game looks great why can t it be on my xbone x oh well,1
i love this game,0
you remember that spider man game for ps the mechanics were almost the same insomniac games made it better it s incredible the work that they accomplished,0
that dashboard confessional reference tho,0
spiderman black ops come on ign are you high,0
to low,0
how is it not a tho,1
if i bought spider man for ps i would only do freeroaming while playing spiderman theme in the back,0
out of too much webs,0
it s like gta batman combined with spiderman,0
to much buildings,0
yeah a full away from fortnite,0
i feel getting this game even though i dont like spider man,0
really,0
not enough feels,0
this game is just pure awesome don t see how it didnt get at least a controls are amazing swinging through the city is awesome learning new skills and developing new devices as you progress through the game is so cool the story is awesome,1
quick time events oh boi,0
ps marvel s spiderman shadow of the tomb raider,0
i cleared the game with completion i would give the game cons could ve done more with sable repetitive tasks for demon thug prisoner sable crimes,0
too many buildings,0
not enough call of duty or battle royale or cod zombies,0
doesn t make you feel like spider man enough,0
not enough spiders,0
surely they re not gonna say it they said it,0
can you play online with freinds,0
this review made me feel like spider man,1
can you play as batman,1
can t wait till angry joe reviews it that ll truly let me know if it s worth it,0
this game really got me feeling like spiderman,0
this guy has a lot feelings towards spidey,0
lol no m it was a,0
i thought the boss battles were pretty basic especially on the hardest difficulty besides taskmaster i thought that was pretty solid more fights like that,0
to every one who wants to play spiderman on any console or pc etc just keep tweeting we want spiderman on the name of console or pc,0
dunkey sent me,0
apparently jonah hill now does game reviews,0
swinging around is simply spectacular me i see what you did there,1
spoiler alert wish you would of said something because you talk about the story and ruin things for ppl not that far into the game your assessment of combat is very short coming until you start to get the basic nature of the combat system you cannot simply do what you show in this video it actually takes quite a bit of time to get basics yet alone much of the advanced stuff you show in this video you rarely have time to do anything you show in video before you are dead,0
ign low key gave this game an out of because they didn t include any of tobey maguire s spider man suit,0
wait is the slow spinning redemption title card a reference to vindicated a song from the spider man soundtrack so meta,0
i don t get this review this game makes you feel like spiderman,0
yeah that s great ign but did you feel it,1
best super hero game ever played out of thumbs way up out of stars thank you insomniac and marvel and sony they really delivered on this game and most of thank you to the game developers,0
i m so annoyed with all of these games being in manhattan why not the other boroughs such as brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx manhattan is not the only place in new york city,0
really feel like spider man,0
feel count over,1
,1
i wonder what he would review shadow of the tomb raider at,0
dunkey,0
it makes me feel like buying a ps,1
the battle royale mode is great,0
but does it make you feel like spider man,0
great review informative and quick,0
i think you missed the worst part of the game the insane levels of repetition that happens very often in the beginning in combat and almost always in side missions like black cat and the osborn stations missions except the spider drone last one,0
how many feels in this review guess it,0
it really makes you feel like spider man huh who would have thought,0
how does it feel to chew gums,0
do you feel like spiderman,0
i think i m calling the punisher on ign,0
i like how this spider man game feels like spider man this spider man dresses like spiderman to make you feel like you re spiderman also city looks and feels like you re in a spiderman universe not enough rain puddles,0
there s no way this game is anything less than at least a,0
bring this to xbox one,0
this video made me f e e l like spiderman,0
i m gonna hate myself for doing this but not enough uncles were killed don t click read more but the aunt was i told you not to click it,0
ign if you ever read this comment never i would like to suggest that you guys who have meetings with game developers such as spidey to tell them this it would be so cool if you could make spidey like a gran theft auto sure in the main story line make him be a hero with heroic actions but when the story is done let the player do what he wants if he wants to a robber let them and let the environment evolve and react against the chooses the player makes thanks for vid,1
not enough feeeeeeeeeeeeling like spiderman,0
this game makes me feel like spider man this game makes you feel like spider man when i played this game i felt like spiderman this game truly does make you feeeeeeeel like spider man this game makes you feel like batman,0
feelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeelfeel,0
the division is still the best game on ps,0
why ign this game needs but not enough seriously,0
feel like spider man,1
i wonder if it makes you feel like spider man,0
too bad for the people that don t have a playstation i have an xbox one and a nintendo wii and i will not buy a playstation just to play this game i will be waiting for september th for the new tomb raider game which is going to be for both systems i don t know why spider man wasn t for both systems like the previous spider man games as much as i love spider man that s not going to make me buy a playstation that and change that could be for something more important like my rent but wants the playstation goes down to i will pick it up with the spider man game even though it would be played out already by that time but hey it is what it is i rather spend a lot of money on more important things that s just my opinion,0
no real spiders man,0
i would ve loved this game when i was,0
why couldn t greg miller review this,0
,0
fuq all dem xboxers watchingg lol,0

this game is so beautiful worth it alone for swinging around the city,0
feel like spider man,0
dashboard confessional nice reference respect,0
but does it make you feel like batman tho,0
confused why shadow of tomb raider is points better than spiderman,0
mrs stark i don t feel like spider man,0
hr journey say what did you play on easy and skipped most activities that were not main story and all that including the hours you spent just leaping through the city without doing any tasks just because it s so awesome get your story straight according to your own words you ve barely played the game at all why did i even bother watch an ign video it s just another playstation pro promo add rather than a proper review,0
you feel like spiderman,0
not enough pizza missions,0
is it only for ps pro pls not,1
gives a to call of duty every year,0
but how does it make us feel,0
it really makes u fell like spiderman,1
while it does nothing new but it s a fantastic game with a great story,0
dunkey has millions in hours ign makes me feel like dunkey,0
the ending was terrible everyone just goes to jail and then we get another spiderman lol,0
cool video,0
i m just guessing here,0
too much awesome,0
makes me feel like antman,0

the reviewer sounds like a spoiled millennial,0

this game was awesome and it s fun to play i m so excited thanks playstation for friendly neighborhood spiderman,0
video game dunkey,0
it feels like ign review,0
nice boat appearing,0
f e e l,1
sorry ign this is most certainly not a the combat is a blast but can still be challenging even when you have hours of practice it never pushes the easy button the graphics are breathtaking the city looks amazing even when moving at high speed the cutscenes are polished well acted and engaging hearing jj rage about spiderman while you swing around is priceless the webswinging is what every fan of spiderman has been wanting not only is it epic but it s also strangely relaxing the collecting of pigeons drone and bomb challenges are exercises in webswinging skill it is asking how fast and nimble you can be stealth and combat challenges are how you can judge your thug beating skills or noir spidey style the backpacks are little glimpses into spiderman lore and peter parks life all in one the landmarks are nods to real locations in new york excluding mcu buildings which also bring the sense that spidey loves his city the suits are a mix of nods to mcu and some from the movies and comic books most with a unique look and ability also the small but noticable addition to high five new yorkers on the street really makes you feel like your friendly neighborhood spiderman ign get your facts straight,1
there is no big wheel also it made me feel like spiderboy,0
man imagine how much better it would be if it came to pc,0
insomniac devs if you re reading this great somebody send this to them it s a great game but i feel you all forgot to add a double jump action x to charge jump tap x again to do certain flips i feel he s not acrobatic enough in the older spider man games you super jump from building to building and land so hard from free falls that there were imprint cracks in the ground minor details i noticed other than that great game for the new generation great starting point and hope there could possibly be a spider man like the old days i haven t completed the game yet or gathered all of the skills yet so i m hoping i could possibly gain the power to super charge jump until then my thoughts remain the same rating,0
,0
do you really feel like the spider man,0
what ability are you using at beyond and keep up the great work with the podcast,0
this review really makes me feel like spider man,0
i m going to buy a ps just to get this game anyone wanna offer any tips about the console itself buying it etc where is the best place to get a ps used possibly,0
sorry i m at loss what does it feel like again,0
y all are one of the people who made ac creed odyssey,0
dunkey,0
not on xbox,0
wish it was on xbox,0
it really makes me feel like spoderdude,0

speektakulur,0
take a shot every time he says feel,0
unfair review,0
it made me feel like spiderman,0
waiting for a go bowling with roman dlc,0
oohhhh noo the feelings,1
but doesn t it make you feel like spider man,0
this game is incredible fun and a masterpiece i enjoyed every second of it especially the story spiderman is one of my favorite superheroes alongside ironman villains on the other hand are more enjoyable especially the rhino i mean that villain is scary af big props to the workers who make new york city like in real life it s really incredible to experience that the combat is overall great as well the web swinging is so much fun it s like you keep going and going until you find dumbass thugs all over the city to fight for i like miles morales this character is growing on me since spiderman into the spider verse i like the social media like the twitter whom spiderman has it was very creative and funny at the same time overall i would give this rating is for the well done game it s definitely worth the wait i hope there ll be sequel,1
what you came for,0
im really feeling this review,0
hey imsoniac games i hope for dlc i can play as spider man of the game i don t care for mj a and miles it s lame and if there s going to be sneaky missions i want to be spider man so i can also take them down i m sure that s a big reason you didn t get a better score on your review,0
but does it make me feel like spider man,0
this game makes you feel like your in attack on titan but will no titans or swords,0
awesome game i love it,0
this makes you feel like watching a review on spider man,0
man i ve always wanted to feel like spiderman,0
omg this dude sounds just like doc oc,0
i love that you can feel like spiderman,0
qchuiet,0
yeah it makes you feel like spider man but does it make you feel like spider man,0
it makes you feel like spider man,0
i only played about hrs so far and i love the general feel of the game but i am annoyed of they lazy criminals creating they all are generic black ski mask guys i mean really heading into and the black ski mask is still the creative criminal look in a game design like random characters and let them do crime make some be the same people caught before and remember what happen last time new age gaming come on fun game though,0
to much feeling like spider man,0
but does it make u feel like spiderman or batman,0
is this for n,0
too much fighting,0
you can t ignore how much this makes you feel like spider man,0
this for me is how a spiderman movie should be its funny how insomniac knows how to get the soul of whatever project they are working on amazing company no little kid spiderman jokes to put off the bad guys no antman comedian b movie and a more serious tone on the story even the soundtrack has the strings reminiscent of the spiderman movie once again hats off for all the amazing people that worked on this game would love for you guys to tackle the metroid prime franchise i can dream a bit lol,1
did you seriously give fortnite but this not at least wow that makes me feel like spiderman,0
spider man makes you feel like batman,0
this game makes you f e e l like spider man,0
really feel like spiderman,0
really makes you feel like spiderman,0
really makes you f e e l like spiderman,0
ign is a joke,0
aside from the rating how did it make you feel,0
f e e l,0
i think personally better than the arkham series which i adored,0
yeah yeah we get it but does it make you feel like spiderman,1
spider man really makes you feel like your batman,0
this review really made me feel like spiderman,0
too much felling like spider man,0
every time he says that it makes you feel like spiderman or something roughly equivalent,0
no big wheel,0
really makes me feel nauseous,0
man after watching this review i feel like aquaman,0
makes you feel like batman,0
does it make you feel like spider guy tho,0
feeeeeeeel feel feeling feel seriously embarassing review,0
the spider man of ps don t know we are controling him he is not real some times i think that we are real or not is some one controling us,0
i don t like how the character models move in cinematics it feels unnatural,0
hmm this reminds me of the uncharted controversy underrated for sure,0
great to play but bad to stream,0
lmao this is probs plagourised,1
ps pro was a mistake,1
spider man fortnite wat,0
ign too much buildings,1
not enough puddles,0
so it s worse than fortnite,1
makes you feel like spiderman,0
i want a ps now lmao,0
so let me guess this game gets a while shadow of the tomb raider gets something s fishy,0
after beating i give it a the middle of the game drsgged out for so long and was so boring ending was the best i just wish more moments like that were sprinkled throughout the game never settle we could of had a way better story,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
i got two things to say insomni c spider man got an on metacritic and an on ign without the decimal point is is the score of the game on metacritic waddafak,0
too much web ign,0
i got an xbox pubg ad before this,0
his voice is annoying,0
pes got but spider man naw son this can t be life,0
tomb raider is better than spiderman ign wtf i hit myself times,0
ea single player games are dead insomniac hold my beer sony santa monica hold my beer capcom hold my beer platinum games hold my beer guerrilla games hold my beer machinegames hold my beer team ninja hold my beer cd projekt red hold my beer and every other publisher i didn t forget,1
gamers today perfect fantastic crap don t buy worst game ever,0
wow is it just me that coincidently got a venom trailer before the video started,0
watching this video made me feeeeel like spider man,0
anyone have an xbox and watching this,0
games generally are getting so much harder these days to find issues with so ign s like what do we do oh just talk about pacing issues,0
no venom but that s probably for the sequel,0
whyyyy,0
spoiler alert the ending was crazy mind blowing,0
city is in chaos prisoners have escaped and four gangs are fighting for turf better catch that pigeon while avoiding snipers and rocket launchers,0
for a single player game i will give it definitly a,0
the music from sounds a bit like the thor the dark world theme,0
doooode thank goodness i ve been waiting for ign to i never cared i was gonna buy this game anyways,0
what a game,1
so wait this is prototype with less open world and boring press x x x x fight system,1
i hope insomniac makes a videogame of thor s adventures next,0
why does my review have only views,0
honestly to me this game was overhyped finished it on hardest difficulty don t get me wrong great game combat fluid like spiderman combat should be story was alright bit underwhelming in my opinion and the side quest missions were tedious boring and repetitive didn t enjoy those hammered them out for though all in all enjoyed not sure it was worth my preorder but to each is on,0
should ve had more knack,0
other than the kingpin and shocker boss battles i thought the rest were great,0
the game deserves at least a you assnuts,0
i rate it it s awesome,0
most accurate review score tbh it s great but not a masterpiece personally i rate it,1
njoy every minute of my ps spiderman bundle my xbox one will be collecting dust ill just use it for kodi k dvd player my music media sell all my xbox games buy ps ones to replace,0
any game over should be a lot more than hours of gameplay,0
man i feel like batman,1
spiderman game makes you feel like a woman ign,0
i bet this game will be the game of the year,1
thumbs down for the,1
spider plushie,0
i just beat the game,0
goty,1
on the spider man in game twitter feed someone says insomniac games will be announcing a new game this week,0
i m looking to gameshare with someone who bought this digitally i digitally pre ordered bo so you ll be getting that as well as some other games i have digitally,0
am i the only one who wants this to come to the switch imagine flinging around manhattan on the go,0
theres no fall damage in this game lol its fun but are they making it for babies,1
makes you feel like spiderman,0
really more like,0
game informer rated it a they ve always kept it a,0
have a day off,1
insert joke about stolen review here,0
ign stop trying you re a meme spider man deserves way better than an and there s no way around that,0
marvel s doflamingo,0
the boss fights were basically all the same in the way you beat them i do agree with that and really a small learning curve with the web swinging you d have to have never picked up s controller for that to be true it was just so sad that this game was soooo short this game is just so fun but the fun ends in a few short gameplays i hope this game never is referred to as an easy platinum,0
hey i got this for free no lie thankyouuu game share,0
too spoiley of a review,0
lmao he used the focus building suit power for the whole game,0
they rated it lower than fortnite,0
this game really makes you feel like batman,0
fuk yeah i ve got vids on it already it s awesome,0
he gave it a you re welcome,0
ign not enough spiderman out of,0
and why they do not talk about the errors of the ai that hangs if you attack it and the reflections of the buildings that are false,1
too many webs,0
i went into this game thinking it was hyped up and gonna be a out of honestly it s fuckin amazing,1
is it just me or is josh keaton from the spectacular spider man animated series the voice of spider man in game,0
there s that phrase again makes you feel like spiderman,0
spider man is a ten in my book,1
to much webs,0
ign gave the batman arkham knight score,1
it just seems like a slightly improved spider man from ps lol,0
i kind of wish marvel s spiderman was part of the mcu i like my games to be canon,0
stan lee cameo at micks and jeff the badass cop made me fell in love with this game for me,0
this game is pretty great i would even say amazing and spectacular and quite frankly pretty user friendly too i would even say it s one of the ultimate spider man experiences okie spider man puns aside this game really is great i m a little annoyed that the reviewer seemed annoyed at the game letting him pick the suit powers i really liked that the game let you tailored itself to your play style that s just me though,0
pacing issues is the dumbest critique you can make in an open world game the order in which you did the quests were your choice ha dit been a linear level based game this would make sense but no two people will pace an open world game exactly the same,0
bhaiya ap rhte kaha ho,0
ill wait until christmas for it to be on sale for bucks,0
this game makes you feel like batman,0
me stark i don t feel like spider man,0
what a dumb score just give it a,0
not enough one night stands,0
i ll enjoy my forza horizon,0
too many buildings,0
i want the fps version of this,0
anyone else have the want to do the web swinging in vr and play mirrors edge in vr too,0
if you fall at front of civillian they will fall and suprise,0
i bought this game and it turns out to be so fun my brother played and the suits look so cool,0
idea of the top of my head but who thinks when you beat the story there should be a historical missions mode like this game is taken place where peter has been spider man for a long time an has fought a lot of villains already so there should be like a uncle bens killer mission green goblin stuff like that an the missions could unlock new suits like toby maquire like does anyone agree with me,0
i m not buying this unless the web sticks to the sky,0
verry expensive,0
xbox x,0
spiderman,0
this game is amazing i dont understand how it got its one of the best games ive played in a long time,1
great game,1
finally a great spider man game and it was achieved by letting another and better developer make the game instead of letting treyarch and activision make it which was why all the spider man games in the past were horrible and they kept letting the same developer make it sequel after sequel they finally smartened up and let someone else do it,0
define feel,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
does the game let you swing around the city by choosing where i stick the web or is it magic webs in the sky like post the spiderman game it s the only thing i care about,0
this review is ok i guess but i want a fresh take from filip miucin,0
this reviewer is ridiculas im never listening to another ign review ever this game does not feel repetative at all this guy is way off and overly critical i ve finished the game and this is by far the worst review of an incredibly amazing game thats even possibly better then batman see u later ign im never trusting ur reviews again,0
in,0
ps nba xbox wnba,0
when you make a review to watch another review lmfao,0
i get it s made only for ps but it should ve also been on xbox,0
if it plays more like spiderman and not amazing spiderman am in,0
unboxing marvel s spider man special edition ps special progamingshop preorder edition,0
will there also be a pc version,0
makes you feel like spoderman,0
streaming this game right now and duuude it s amazing,0
am i the only one who don t feel hype of this game,0
this review has so many spoilers,0
hey i remember this guy he did the ssx ign review five years ago,0
untouched kill sniper shootout dub go watch,0
over rating,0
ign gave it a slightly lower score than the competition thats ok though ign reviews mean nothing now after their little fiasco never took them seriously anyways if a game is really hyped up ign will always give it a by default,0
not enough puddles no lootboxes meh,0
who has this and wants to gameshare,0
too high,0
spider man ps makes you feel like a realistic spider man with its ups and its downs but hey isn t that life at least insomniac got to cherry pick them,0
i want spiderman,0
does it have a pizza mission tho,0
if you watch someone fly off a building after you throw it kick them they eventually trigger a web that zips them to safety,0
this game really makes me feel like batman,0
lmao he said it,0
it s a great game,0
too many spider webs,0
not call of duty ign,0
wtf is up with the audio,0
art thou feeling it now mr krabs,0
it really reminds me of the batman games gameplay,0
hands down i m recording a no commentary playthrough and it s amazing,0
really makes you feel like batman,0
i think its a masterpiece i find everything awesome with this game,1
ign incorrect garbage news,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
i m really enjoying it its the first spider man game i ve played since the ps not counting lego games,0
someone call dunkey,0
anybody else give this review cool points for that dashboard confessional reference,0
be honest it s batman in spidey s suit without counters,0
i wish tom holland voices the character and peter parker looked like him,0
these reviewer are trash,0
p or fps no p on both ps and ps pro enjoy,0
aunt may dies,0
i just beat the game this game deserves a the only reason its not a for me is the ridiculous mj missions i wish i could just skip them and watch a cutscene instead but the rest of the game is perfection the most fun i ve had in a game this gen,0
i love how the arkham games always has people over analysing how batman s punches would kill people but nobody says a thing when spidey s throwing more thugs off buildings than hurricane katrina by the way has anyone noticed how much this game makes you feeeeeel like spider man,0
first person view is something i d like to be able to do maybe also add vr to that experience,0
spider man on the ps makes you feel like batman,0
i m a little disappointed greg didn t handle this review,0
i just finished it lives up to the hype great story,0
looks like all the other ones,0
waaaaaaay to many spoilers in this review dont show those story cutscenes,0
how tf does ac origins get a that game is so repetitive it has many pointless side missions and all you do is attack roman bases even in the main story spider man is at it s worst a gameinformer got it the rating right a,0
not enough grass,0
wow it s a fun game but it s not an it s more like a sometimes it got me feeling like i was playing a batman game,0
f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
this game honestly deserved,0
just completed the game the best comic book game ever,0
seriously play the fu in game guys it s much better than what you see in the video,0
hey buddy how can i send you a couple of dollars so you can go somewhere and buy yourself a personality,0
you re welcome,1
yeah this shouldve been a higher rating i played it and honestly one of the best games i ve ever played and i ve been a gamer for about years,0
greatest game this year i went to the halloween party as spider punk and it was the best feeling ever,0
it seems like there really isnt much to this game,0
but did the game really make you feel like spider man,0
this or fifa help me please idk wat to pick,0
this is the best game to date and you gave it an wake up dude,0
this game really makes you feel like batman,0
hour thats how the game is,0
this game looks awsome why is it ps only any xbox or switch players with me,0
this is why i don t like you ign whenever a review comes out we don t know who the hell is reviewing the game odd pacing is such a personal thing to an individual thing that i just had yo comment how bad this is,0
i m gnot a gnelf,0
i feel like sunset overdrive another game by the same developer is far better because if you played both it feels very unoriginal and a lot of the mechanics were striped right out of that game,0
how in the hell is this a but most call of duty games are just dying to see what you rate black ops cause if it is higher then this i just can t take y all seriously lol,0
,0
it makes you feel like batman,1
yuri lowenthal also voices sasuke in naruto,0
sills,0
harmless quick time events quick time events are almost a deal breaker for me,0
doesn t have battle royal mode,0
wonder what the cast of avengers have to say about this,1
here s something cool there s a hidden easteregg in the new game it needs you to be at the right place at the right time and a fake jumps out of a van and points at you if you hit the button at the perfect moment your will take a screenshot for you and going to look like on the picture share this see who gets the first pic,0
reminds me of second son little bit,0
i just realized that spider man leaves spiderwebs everywhere so who tf cleans them up,0
ok but how did it make you feeeeel tho,0
wow i really need a ps,0
it really makes you feel like spider man,0
our of too many webs,0
just wait for dunkeyreview,0
somehow ign gave madden a higher score lmao,0
you guys should be giving this a or a so much better than any spider man game i played,0
i still do not understand why so many people watches igns reviews this review was pure garbage the reviewer said a lot and didn t say anything at the same time they give a score but they don t tell you why they give that score there is no breakdown of graphics sounds gameplay story ign reviews are just the worst,0
because its not black ops ign,0
silky smooth game doesn t run at fps sorry but your pun doesn t hold,0
but how does it make you feeel,0
marvels spider man makes you feel like spider man,0
this is my new favorite ps game,0
does it have multiplayer,0
best game,0
really makes you feel like batman spiderman,0
this looks just like dark souls,0
too much spider not enough man ign,0
slow spinning redemption i understand that reference,0
not enough puddles ign with a shitty review again,0
this is a game that could have been on all platforms but big and bad sony wants to keep all the big name games for themselves they know spider man is a very popular marvel hero and character but i will be playing shadow of the tomb raider gears of war next year hopefully no game delays kindgom hearts next year crackdown is a xbox exclusive game at the end of this year,0
it just makes you feel like spiderman,0
this at least deserves a,0
there s no way you spent hours just swinging on your web through the city that sounds insanely boring and you also had a review to make,1
i m no salty or something but best comic superhero game is batman arkham city beacuse batman is better than spiderman my opinion and l love more arkham series beacuse of the realistic atmosphere by the way this game is very cool,0
what does does even mean to u,1
the real question is does this spider man game make you feel like you,0
imagine if spider man was multiplayer lol,0
yippie yay spider man now give us a real and proper avengers game please,0
this game reminds me of batman arkham series l wish they could make another game,0
i do love insomniac games a lot ever since i played ratchet and clank since i was,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
miles in spiderman,0
spiderman ps makes you feel like spiderman batman makes you feel like batman,0
slow spinning redemption nice nod to vindicated from spider man,0
,0
i havent played it yet but from seeing gameplay it looks like it deserves a at least,0
they should add spiderman online,0
glad they used toby mcguire spidey,0
a r k h a m s e r i e s is still the b e s t,1
hey ign i don t feel like spiderman,1
this review made me feel like i shouldn t watch ign anymore,0
a review of this review rating bad wording and choice of critisms also judging by the fact he could rate an open world game in days shows he didn t actually play the game as intended,0
just remember people these are the same people that gave horizon zero dawn a and only gave the witcher a,0
i m laughing at all those xbox gamers looking in envy,0
i just got an add for the venom movie before a video of the spiderman game,0
basically this shits kinda lame,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
overated,0
most def above,0
no battle royale,0
too much web swinging ign,0
game is boring same as all the others all you can do is swing around and button bash,0
see my channel,0
to get your game to make it battle royal not open world fun combat hours of game play and you can play as f ing spider man,0
haven t been this in love with a game since skyrim or the last of us played for hours straight and i m only through it webbing around is endlessly fun easily an or,1
these guys think their review is the only valid one and all the others don t matter,0
the game is awesome i ve seen some it before like the game saw puzzles and the backpacks from part one wich is why spidey says i remember this from high school,0
i have to say that the combat is very lame boring and lackluster even arkham asylum had much better and enjoyable combat,0
so anyone especially my pc and xbox players hyped for the avengers project,0
game of the year,1
the review was praising the game the whole way and then gives it an the guy didnt say one thing that was bad about the game,0
game is freaking awesome love just swinging through the city and the car chases,0
this is a terrible review hey guys i didn t really play this game to its full capacity cause i was scared to and here s huge chunks of the story ruined,0
if this game doesnt make you feeeel like spiderman you can always trade it in to anyone of our stores for cents towards the pre order of black ops black ops will truly make you feeel like a camper restrictions apply,0
released when,0
now bring it to xbox,0
i m going to have to check this game out love and impressed with what i see,0
bogos i say,0
it really makes you feel like you are spiderman,0
mr stark i don t feeeeel so hood,0
i still think spiderman is kinda better the combat system in this game looks like arkam games,0
i bought the game i was a great decision,0
your small criticisms sound more like preference for your game play rather than actual criticism of the game,0
it was when a plumber does it,0
me getting a current xbox add,0
lmao hour adventure so rent this game then,0
spiderman only shame on you ign,0
i bet corey taylor is playing this a lot,0
mario odessy,0
batman arkham series spider man series,0
dude probably going to be the best series on youtube love ur vids man and also i need a new ps bc my sister broke it my instagram is kaleb,0
i ll give it a out of,0
this review really makes me feel like ign,0
so i was checking the twitter feed for spidey and someone asked if he could retrieve a balloon their kid lost,1
i would like there to be more things to do after you finish the game for example now i have completed it i can no longer play as peter parker or mj and no activities come close to the campaign missions,0
my death cousin wishes there was captions in this video,0
as much as i like homecoming i think that the game s plot was far more interesting and had an emotional depth to it raimi s spiderman also had an emotional depth to it and thats one of the reasons why i loved them so much this game s plot is just perfect well done insomniac well done,0
wish i have a ps,0
hi all i have old ps i bought it at any chance it will lagged too much if i play this game using my old ps any advice thanks,0
i nearly cried baka,0
too much city ign,0
hey i just gt a ps today spider man or nba k,0
its not on pc,0
i ve had a lot of fun playing it so far,0
although i havent finished it yet this game has been wonderful it makes spider man feel so human and the relationships are so believable,0
i may feel like spider man but will i feel like spiderman,0
reminds of aot d maneuvering gear on ps feels awesome,0
ha feel,0
marvel makes you really feel like spider man ign you say games are repetitive yet your repetitive oh well at least you finished the actual game,0
i thought the graphics would be more high quality bc it s ps,0
i give it a no bruce campbell narration if it had it i would give this game a,1
to many feels in the game,0
this review pretty much said nothing,0
lmao what s wrong with the writing this specific sentence is repeated all over the video makes you feel like spiderman,0
f e e l,0
ign straight spoiling the whole game with the gameplay videos,0
as an xbox almost makes makes my wanna buy ps but not really cause i cant waste money like that,0
says he wasn t expecting such a great and moving story then deducts points for its pacing err ok,0
okay how much is it,0
wtf is oleg from saints row doing there,0
would ve been a if jk simmons was in it,0
im trying to avoid any kinds of spoilers,0
that vindicated reference,0
when reading the comments here i see way too much ps spiderman to think that every comment is unbiased how about we lose the ps as a descriptor and start really analyzing why we allow companies as we do politics to force us into thinking we only have this option over the other i say we start praising the products companies politics that allow for a cross play option or a majority beneficial choice this type of product is polarizing and regardless of its gameplay is ultimately hollow in the long run,0
s iderman,0
im six hours deep this game is truly amazing they did spiderman right and i say that with meaning bravo insomniac bravo,0
i want this so bad but i play on xbox,0
not enough uncles were killed,1
it really makes you feel like batman,0
that noir suit feels like a noir suit,0
i don t like the batman games so i m assuming i won t like this one,0
they need to release a spider royale mode that would be sick,0
so it s mediocre like any non fan boy thought exactly,0
this might possibly became the reason for me to afford a ps but no one selling it here,0
too many spider webs ign,1
honestly though i m disappointed with this game i played all the batman arkham games and this one is just so disappointing to me it not bad but there isn t really anything original about this game,0
f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
ign man vs spider man,0
this game really makes you feel like spider man,0
looks empty and repetitive,0
red dead redemption spider man,0
the way this guy talks makes me sick,0
not even a,0
this game is the best ps game since knack babbyyyyyyy,0
i just want to get the game so i can swing around,1
tree,0
ign this game is so amazing it s so great it s the complete package it has everything it s also ign,0
your profile picture doesn t help to trust in your review,0
why does this look like watchdogs,0
what a godawful review i wanna hear more about gameplay not about how relatable the story was,0
did jonah hill do this review cuz dude sounds exactly like jonah hill,0
im doing a walkthrough on my channel come check me out,0
came for a spider man review but the realized how i just can t consume the mainstream reviews anymore it s feels empty hopefully angry joe will do a review,0
if it was cod then they would have given,0
makes you feel like batman can t wait for dunkey to review this he even says it more than once,0
hours tho,0
just bought the game waiting for it to download,0
bring it to pc,0
it s literally just okay not worth the,0
the only important question is does spidy has the awsome new xperia xz or a y flagship from sony,0
spider man makes you feel like batman,0
but are the web organic,0
no big wheel,0
is there a spoderman costume,0
too many spiders ign,0
spiderman did you just assumed his gender ffs,0
whaaaaaaaaaa,0
if you have ps you might as well try brawlhalla while you re at it,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
but does it make you feel like batman,1
so its basically like the infamous series,0
but no xbox one wtf,0
too bad this game isn t released for pc,0
sound a lot like the arkham knight so it should be fun to play,0
did you guys still this review as well,0
i heard if you abadone a mission you will start all missions again,0
what s with the ad,0
i love this game,0
i honestly think that there should be a game where you create your own superhero where you create your own abilities skills tech gadgets gear and costume and you can choose if you want to be more of a villain hero antihero mercenary whatever i think it would be fun,0
this game is spectacular no it s amazing however this game doesn t make me feel like spider man out at like comment and subscribe to ign don t forget to click that bell to be part of the notification gang,0
hours,0
i don t know why people making fun of the reviewer comment game makes you feel like your spiderman he is pointing out positive aspect of the game unless the game doesn t make you feel like spiderman then say that but if it is true then don t make fun of him,0
is this ps exclusive will it be released on pc,0

should i get this or k,0
haha spiderman is not on xbox take that xbox owners cries in forza horizon,1
cant w to play this on my xbox x with superior frame rate and resolution,0
they must change there mind and make a pc version it looks great like batman arkham series its too bad for the people that dont have ps cant play it,0
hey everyone im doing a spiderman serie just finished the part really great content go get a look if you want thank you,0
only been playing the game for a few hours and it is really fun however has any one noticed things like characters mouths not moving when they talk or characters floating in mid air instead of walking or other glitches like this the game has only been out for a few hours so i m hoping this will get fixed later on,0
infamous clone boring,0
too much spider not enough man,0
but all cod games get over a,0
traveling looks kinda like moving around in the attack on titan games,0
so spider man for the ps still hasn t been dethroned,0
this makes you feel like you are watching ign,0
help me out to get this game venmo tmwalters,0
too many buildings,1
guys are mad people from xbox,0
i ve not enjoyed a game this much in years this is definately a must play for anyone on the fence just swinging around the city exploring is entertaining this limp wristed review is terrible you ll be hearing from my member of parliment,0
gameplay that made me feel like spider man,1
can someone tell me is it worth buying,0
i need to feel what he feels,0
another point to sony your move microsoft,0
too much spider man,0
that dashboard confessional spiderman ost reference,0
this game really gives you the feels ya know,0
boring,0
why not give it a,0
this game is fantastic on par with the arkham games if not better in my opinion,0
mgtow spider man do it,0
what this is a solid masterpiece it must get out of,1
its a great game but give it an only ign could do this lol,0
this is all nice and everything but will this game make me feel like spider man,0
but madden gets a okay,0
but do you deliver pizzas and take pictures of spiderman,0
so basically the same as every spiderman game with graphics a little better how boring,0
fweel wike spiderman,1
all the feel memes aside looks pretty cool gonna give it a shot but not right now my backlog keeps growing uncontrollably,0
remember this only persons review personally myself,1
too many webs,0
guess you should down your grade for this game,0
makes you f e e l like spiderman,0
not gonna lie i love spider man but this looks so repetitive,0
no pizza mini game no buy,0
i only trust reviews dunkey and killian,0
hours what a joke no thanks looks like every spider man game made so far,0
why is everyone stuck to him saying it makes you feel like spiderman,1
nice now we need a new arkham game,1
really makes you feel like ba spider man,0
spooderman ps makes you feel like hooman ign,0
too much mary jane always getting in trouble,0
i come across this review on the web,0
lol i thought it would be a lower than that,0
lol,0
should of been called dust simulator,0
this review made me feel like a guy watching a review,0
but the real question is does it make you feel like spiderman,1
got an ad for pubg before this poor wittle xbox,0
thought spiderman was dead,0
why not just,0
i didn t know that spider man was a vergin,0
i hate this guys voice,0
this look likes infamous with spider man powers and abilities,0
you should remove point for being exclusive,0
is that eddie huang,0
how are you gonna praise the game for making it sound like the greatest thing in video game history and then give it an,0
,0
so this game is ps exclusive,0
odd score why not juet give it a,0
slgihtly disappointed they didn t include the my balloon missions,0
peter has telekinesis confirmed,1
spiderman is just the hero version of gta,0
he uses more adjectives in this review that i have in my entire life,0
makes me wish i had a ps,0
when did josh gad start reviewing for ign,0
knack babyyyyyyy,0
madden gets a spiderman gets a something doesn t add up here,0
friends but she wants to be in the spider zone,0
i don t care what people say spiderman on the ps best spiderman game ever made will never be a spiderman game like that again,1
snap,1
hold up why no spoiler alert man i was expecting the usual review that tells you how the gameplay felt then you suddenly dropped specific characters and stories,0
i originally wasn t thinking about getting the game but my spidey senses are tingling,0
i m subscribed to ign just for the comment section and the drama lmao,1
wow you won t guess what add i got before this,0
i m just made they made this an exclusive,0
spider man for the ps vita makes me feel like papa john,0
is anyone else encountering visual bugs during certain cutscenes,0
is it just me or did they just make spider man look more like deadpool,0
so this is being compared to the arkham games a lot and you got to remember those games were pretty ground breaking when they first came out swinging around nyc as spiderman is nothing new but judging from the review scores it has from all sources insomniac has done a really great job on this one hats off,0
not that is a bad score but seriously less than fortnite come on ign,0
can we play this online with friends,0
so this game is based in the mcu,0
why tf is this only for playstation this is some bs,0
this game crushes the history of bad spider man games although there are exceptions spiderman spider man enter electro spider man and ultimate spider man,0
game rating of this game,0
too cinematic doesn t feel like a game,0
batman remains more iconic and arkham games more superior,0
i think all games should be doing free dlc s i don t get how mhw can manage to give them for free but every other game you spend nearly as much as the game you bought just be kind for once other than that this game gave me shivers been waiting so long for it,0
im sad it s only ps i was honestly looking forward to this game,0
why do the graphics look worse,0
why not why you have to put it,0
goty idc what you say ign,1
spiderman will have a battle royale,0
,0
i mostly watch ign reviews now for some lulz,0
doesn t make you feel like superman ign,0
doesn t make you feel like batman ign,0
hours i d wait a year and buy it for half the price,0
of the review is compliments so why instead of doesn t make sense,0
can you make a comparison with the trailer like you did with gow,0
ign spends minutes gushing over a game to give it a i hate you ign,0
wow,0
xbox fans are burning,0
the review sounds more like a,0
what fuke it s,0
too many towers,0
are you feeling it now mr krabs,0
i just want a story about miles,0
i got a ad and the ad was this game lol,0
i m playing it right now and recommend everyone to buy it played many free roam games this has to be one of the best,0
so the first hours are boring everything in between is boring i ll pass what a disappointment luckily forza horizon is about here,0
it just got released then they made a review i dont know if u can make a review for just days,0
ohh man looks amazing,1
geez why do ign game reviews feel so fake,0
so yet another spider man game like all other ones can you play as a villain in this one can you play as another unddr used hero like captain america if not then why even bother buying,0
this shloudve been a or psh,0
this is the dark souls of spiderman,0
this review made me feel like ign needs better writers,0
boy will be the game of the year,0
i am gettin it today,0
the full batman i mean spider man experience,0
tobey maguire is the best spider man had to get that out there,0
an ultimate alliance game would be epic,0
i m disappointed that there s no venom in the game he s the most exciting villain in spiderman if not marvel,0
idk i refuse to fall for it again spider man games have been so underwhelming,0
finally we have a spider man game that could top s spider man i feel bad i don t have a ps yet but for now ps owners enjoy,0
s basically a right,0
how can you review a game in days,0
this game is the pure reason i regret getting an xbox,0
what i really want to know is how the combat compares to something like bayonetta or devil may cry is it automatic like the arkham series or do you have direct control like bayonetta and dmc as always pro reviews fail when it comes to explaining the gameplay and so i always end up having to gamble on games and times out of it all ends in disappointment i really wish our critics would actually dive in to the gameplay and inform us about the actual game for once then i might be able to make an informed purchasing decision but reviews like this tell me nothing in regards to what i want and need to know prior to buying a game i m not taking the risk this time i ve made it my mission to find out whether the combat is automated or not before i make a purchasing decision if anybody here in the comments can help me with this i d appreciate it big time,0
i got an ad for the game,0
call of duty makes you feel like a ptsd veteran struggling to find a job,0
did he say hours or hours,0
nothing will ever be better than spiderman back when it came out before the movie with toby mcguire,0
really makes you feel like a battletoad,0
masterpiece,0
how big is the day update for physical copies,0
slow spinning redemption nice touch with the dashboard confessional reference to the second film,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
i ll just accept the pompousness and haughty compliance of my disdain for your review by saying i wish i could take it and revise it like your former english teachers who had dark obsessions of halloween you re method and style is too wish washy to get any feeling of where you re going with this in the end i don t know what to make of your judgement because it feels too bland too droll all with enthusiasm editing your own critiques it makes the final score seem ambivalent and thus inconsequential take it how you will but if you analyzed this script the way we heard it you d agree if you had no biases,1
madden has a higher rating than this game lol,1
when you don t have a ps,0
and this is not coming to pc sad,0
web of shadows was the best spidey game this new one looks like the batman arkham asylum series with webs thrown in,0
this made me feel like i m watching another typical ign review,0
not cod,0
not enough gun play,0
too much spider man,0
guessing game oh should ve known they don t give normal scores also it made me feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel like spiderman,1
no joke,0
hours that s very short,0
i want to hurt the civilians not to be evil that would be super cool,0
spider man ign,0
when does this come out,0
what about glitches,0
no pizza minigame,0
is this ps exclusive,0
exelan ca made me laugh from beginning to end me too i made video tell me what you think about it to allow me to improve,0
video was written by videogamedunkey,0
is it better than breath of the wild tho,0
did he just say hours isent this a full priced game,0
wait we ve spun webs over new york before why is this a selling point,0
dislikes xbox fan boys,0
it makes you feel like spider man,0
looks like after batman arkham injustice we are going to have another great superhero video game,1
this is better than cod aw though,0
this guy is an xbox fanboy,0
i have the ps slim does it run smoothly on that,0
the spectacular spider man i should be playing the heck out of this one soon,0
very funny check it out win prizes,0
but does it make you feel like spider man,0
if i get the game imma unlock all the suits then all mortals shall perish,1
what about xbox,0
the game looks great too bad i have an xbox,0
i m enjoying it but honestly it plays like a reskinned batman arkham knight,0
rent the game from boomerang,0
spooderman,0
cool now all i need is a ps and,0
enter small face lezydv enable dance eliminate discrimination extremely picture,0
not enough spiders ign,0
feeeeeeel,0
i love that they used anime voice actors,0
ign is a complete joke cod gets every year and they rate this pathetic channel,0
the game isn t even out yet how did they do this review,0
i really liked the reviewers voice actually,0
so there s nothing else to do once you finish the story,0
so can i finally feel like spiderman even though i m iron man,0
less then an hour left,0
insomniac done well to the limitations of the franchise just remember that people,0
one more day we ll see how it goes,0
toaster in the bath tub,0
i bought a ps tonight just for this game,0
this guy sounds like a years old can t take him serious,0
should ve gone for a,0
tbh i wont buy this game right away but this reveiw was great felt like i played it already,0
this game makes you feel like your batman,0
ign nahhh too many buildings,0
it s compared to batman arkham games,0
can t wait to scoop this in a couple hours,0
aww shi ben riley spidey clone costume what a horrible chromium cover tho clone story line nah,1
i have and xbox and i wanna ps now lol,0
ign not enough puddles,0
this game deserves a,0
terrible review,0
too much web swinging is that meme still funny,1
amazing game but sadly this is one of those games where when your finished with the main story the game is boring,0
too much webs ign,0
can you give mr dikovitch his rent if he fixes the damn door,0
at the end of the day until you play the game yourself only you can be the real judge of whether you enjoy the game or no you know,0
please get rid of thornbush ign,0
i just bought this i feel regret for some reason,0
are u serious ign,1
ultimate spider man is still the best spider man,0
how to change language on this game there is no option in the setting nice job,0
i feel like its watch dogs but with spider man,0
really why not just come on,0
you wanna know what s worthless ign reviews,0
spider man where are you comin from spider man nobody knows who you aaaaaaaaaare,0
gamestop group serial number,0

it made me feel like batman,0

if there is a second game it should be like ultimate spider man that lets you switch between spider man and venom with their own side missions i d be so happy,0
reminder dont watch ign reviews for games i am hyped for,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
anyone else think the guys who s talking sound like anton yelchin,0
insomaniac needs to give us an avengers game omg,0
ign is a l how you gonna give madden a like tf,0
it looks amazing wtf ign,0
woah i was expecting editors choice and up umm what did i miss this review spent the entire time gushing over this game and then gives it an whaaa,0
do they watch dunkey,0
anybody else got it pre loaded and waiting for the countdown to hit zero this game is gonna be epic,1
well i can understand his gripes i think for myself it is something i could probably overlook more easily now if the th edition of call of duty gets over well ign is just a meme at that point,0
but does it have the turnips from super mario brothers,0
as cool as pizza delivery missions might be i want daily weekly and monthly daily bugel challenges to photograph spiderman in different scenarios while in specific costumes or at famous landmarks stuff like that the daily photo challenges could be super easy while the monthly challenge should be very hard and specific,0
looks great but looking forward to spidergeddon which comes out the same day,0
is it actually worth getting i am so unsure at the moment,0
too bad i don t have a ps,0
hours that s it man sony it s a great game i m sure but jesus for dollars here in canada give us at least hours ffs,0
damn i hope it s similar to the old days on ps where you deliver pizza lol the inner kid in me is begging for it,0
it makes you feel like batman,0
is this video janky or is it me,0
game looks boring mash buttons until guys die dodge super easy telegraphed attacks from bosses etc glad i didn t get hyped for this game,0
sounds like peter parker reviewed this,0
i m really annoyed that it s only on ps i have an xbox one and can t afford a ps and am so used to the xbox controller,0
pre ordered it s downloaded and ready to go now we play the waiting game,0
isnt all bosses in everygame pretty much pattern recognition lmao,0
does anybody know if the game has differnt game slot i have to kids but its only a one player game can one play on one saved eith put deleting the others progress,0
vindicated song reference,0
too many webs,0
so basically prototype meets arkham series,0
bring toby mcguire back,0
thanx sony for locking a other game to your system,0
welp rest in piece wallet,0
f e e l,0
so tell you what every time there s a game i want the devs slap me in the face and say hey this game is exclusive to ps if you want to play it go buy a f cking ps why does my luck always have to be so bad when it comes to gaming,0

rolls on just like a condom,0
too much webbing,0
not a gamer but i now want to to play cuz i grew up watching the sam ramey trilogy and loved homecoming,0
i just hope i don t have to collect balloons anymore,0
listen to summa time ft otschris otsmortem bigots prod lemon by ots on,0
did he just say avengers tower,0
rarely pointss out any negatives madden scores higher yup its an ign review,0
im sorry did you say the whole thing was only hours damn,0
xbox users are sweating,0
this review really made me feel like ign,1
the web swinging seems pretty fun,0
dafuq why after all that blabber,0
toy story got a and spider man didn t,0
does it have br tho,1
i only watch their game reviews to see if people catch them plagiarizing in the comments,0
we already lost epic to the masses today we lost spectacular too,0
as long as it makes you feel like spiderman also stop trying to escape the meme and rate it a we all know what you want to say,0
hours,0
this kinda seems like the arkham city but worse,0
,0
it really makes you feel like batman,0
like skyrim with web slinging,0
lol and says it makes you feel like spiderman out of is minimum d,0
i want this on pc,0
but does it make you feel like batman,1
just one sleep away from playing this game the wait is finally over,0
game looks like a damn menace,0
make you feel like spiderman,1
sounds more like a fan boy than a review,0
ign is right the game is not that great is just tasm all over again,0
watch black ops iiii get a lol,0
why spiderman is a black guy i hate that,0
they should ve put tom holland in the game that would ve set it off,1
from this review it looks like one of the spider man games i played on the gamecube the only exception is that they made a longer story line,0
spider man wasn t blowin the right dudes at ign to get a,0
i enjoyed the subtle shout out to the song vindicated slow spinning redemption anyone else notice that,0
you gave cod ww,0
tf why couldn t they just round it up to a like okay don t do my boi spidey like that,0
the narrator sounds like peter parker,0
why does this guy sound like jonah hill,0
the web slinga,0
got a tomb raider ad on this videos,0
will this stay ps exclusive,0
sony won,0
wait wait wait hours seriously that s it that s a little disappointing,0
suppost to be no reviews til release day tho,0
i got an ad for it lol,0
too much buildings,0
easy money,0
so is it worth to buy,0
i liked it when ign used to list the pros and cons at the end of the video,0
booooring i haven t even played it and i m already tired of this game,0
i swear as i am watching this a tiny spider started walking on my mobile screen i blew it away,0
still mad that this isn t iron man instead cause he built the mcu but whatever guess i m buying it,0
,0
i got an xbox ad on this video so ironic,0
insomniacs spider man,0
imma kms i dont have a ps,0
wow this game looks beautiful,0
gamers making fun of ign for giving aaa games high ratings gamers also complain when titles they like start getting reviewed critically you can t have it both ways lads,0
plays on the easiest difficulty i didnt feel encouraged to use any gadgets other than the first two,0
see i was so impressed with spider man on the ps unsure but at a young age i loved and appreciated the swinging and animations and how amazingly you go from building to building now looking at this i feel like that old game finally has a rival with better graphics and a definitely better story and movement i probably won t be getting this but i m excited for people like me who played the old game just to swing around and climb buildings xd,0
it looks like the web of shadows world,0
is a lot lol u guys are goofy,0
can you get knocked down by bike messengers in this game,0
yea re release it with st person compatibility then it ll be a,0
f e e l,1
i bet the person reviewing the game is an xbox fan t no way this is an,0
yep and according to ign call of duty deserves a every year,0
kinda disappointed no mention of regular ps game performance since that s what the majority is still using but hey i guess that s why digital foundry exists nice review none the less,1
i can t wait for this to arrive on friday,0
i m glad all the competent people are leaving ign and doing their own thing,0
too much spider not enough man,0
made me feeeeel like ba i mean spiderman,0
hopefully it comes to xbox rly wonna explore that city,0
i actually feelz like spider man,0
feel like spiderman counter,1
this reminds me of the ps spiderman the nostalgia,1
ign literally this game makes you feeeel like spiderman,1
but how does it feel,1
why did madden get a better score than this,0
hell yeah i m ready to play as spider man this looks fun,0
i m so excited i m getting it tomorrow,0
wtf is up with ign rating system just say out of or go with the rating,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
cartoonish,0
yas i was the first to play on the release date the real one,0
spider man really makes you feel like batman,0
getting this to today with ps pro,0
jesus christ wtf is wrong with you ign,1
so many puns,0
did tom holland voice him,0
sooo f,1
spider man for the ps makes you feel like batman and master chief in an amazing story that is better than the witcher and the best of naughty dog and it is really incredible but the web shooter are an environmental hazard the final score is a,0
just got a trailer for spiderman lmao,1
this game made me feel like spider man i literally turned into spider man i felt like him so much,1
literally just an arkham clone meh arkham is much better if you can only buy this or one of the arkham games definitely go with arkham,0
what does that even mean just round it to or if you don t want to give it a give it an or makes no sense and is pointless ign fix your score system,0
this game really makes you feel like batman,0
just needed more,0
so the front and end of the game have fun boss battles but the middle of it is filler great just like every spiderman movie ever,1
when you have an xbox and can t get the game,1
still didnt beat the arkham series though,0
ign scared of spiders,1
guys this is a hour game i say it would deserve a if it was double that,0
i hate your site pathetic,0
spectacular spectacular spider man spectacular spectacular spider man sorry i had too,0
hours for story i heard it was at at least that was from one of the creators and developers and that was supposed to be with out any of the side missions is that not true,0
mhw but spider man,0
i can finally feel like spiderman,1
im surprised they didn t say it had to many buildings,0
no eating for me this weekend,0
really wanted this game to fail because it s not on xbox,0
spoiler warning eveyone,0
no thanos car,0
i know,0
massive downgrade this is ps s console killer,0
take a shot for every time you hear make you feel like in a ign review,0
batman arkham knight spiderman ps,0
if i loved the batman arkham games will i enjoy this game,0
that s all you need to know,0
a really emotional review but i feel like the unofficial review might be a bit more accurate,0
can t wait to play it oh wait i don t own a ps,0
this game looks wish i had ps,0
only out of this review is extremely disappointing ign,0
i got a spider man ad before this spider man review also the reviewer sounds a bit like tom holland who is spider man,0
seriously sorry ign but i just don t trust you,0
so they re no random crimes to stop i e purse thieves car chases shoot outs robbers random groups of thugs or the occasional person in distress these are what made spider man such an amazing game man game,1
,0
there saved you guys some time,0
they need to add this suit in the game onmitsu black spider man,0
warning you can swim in this game people this is not a drill,0
not buying this game a waste of money,0
you can be scarlet spider yeah that s the only skin i ll be rocking from now on,0
anybody else feel like this guy gave away the whole damn game why do i know when the bosses show up if peter and jane relationship is so relatable why ruin the most relatable part involving the text message why show all the villains luckily for me i m a xbox guy so i was never gonna be able to play this anayway but i m done with ign reviews spoilers,0
coulde be worse we could have felt like the teenage mutant ninja turtles,0
not enough feel,0
too much spider man ign,0
and madden gets,1
hour adventure wtf is this true,0
still can t get over the fact there are grown men hyped to be playing spider men,0
indonesia like dong,0
so is the game really hours long or some of those hours wasted on web slinging,0
ps exclusive,0
when is the xbox one version out,1
i caught that vindicated reference,0
it was worth the hype,0
this time i m agree with ign completely agree this is the highest verdict so far that i found fyi some reviewers gave em the combat system and the storyline are the best stuff in this game remember this is a openworld game apart from the storyline i m pretty sure it ll be more repetitive also we haven t know what we feel after we spend hours playing this game i mean i m pretty sure you will get bored after so many times you just swinging around in concrete jungle,0
no blood no fun,0
you sound like an american tom holland,0
this guys voice is such a stereotypical ign reviewer voice lmao,1
a friend of mine cause he never had a girlfriend,0
i wanted to see a game that technically could not done on any other game console or pc sadly it doesn t,0
there games out there other than fortnight,0
i think i will wait for the dunkey review,0
fifteen hours,0
i swear if fifa gets higher then this then i m done,0
really makes you feel like spider man,0
just so we re clear madden got an and amongst madden players it s considered the worst in years,0
please just have the black suit as a dlc please,0
can t wait to play,0
feeeeeeeeeeellllll like spiderman,0
get it now from amazon,0
is this worth buying,0
no batman,0
ok i m done with ign reviews after that one,0

fire,0
meh this game has too much spiders,0
wow just awesome,1

poor geek that done this review needs a root lol was so happy to be talking to a girl in the game as parker lol,0
all the dunkey memes make m so happy,0
looks great overall had to laugh at the ship which was teleported into the scene,0
i m interested in the freeroom are there little crimes i have to manage or robbery s beside and after the story spiderman did great with this things,0
everywhere is saying it s story lasts hours why is ign wrong about everything,0
i need subs so that i can breastfeed my wolf cubs help a playa out love,0

oof a spider man ad before the video,1

il be doing spider man gameplay over on my channel so guys please hit subscribe,0
cant wait for this foreal,0
can t wait to play assassinbatspider,1
take a shot every time this guy says surprise or delight,0
i just started college sorry school spiderman and k just came out u gotta go and my job i might quit i m jk lol,0
better to wait for all the dlcs to come and buy the game of the year edition at lower price but how many can wait,0
mary jane is like a pre order of claire redfield,0
qte nooo,0
the real question is it better than spiderman on ps,0
this game looks repetitive and boring i ll pass,0
not enough puddle,0
the one thing i can t stand about this game is how when you swing directly into the side of a building even on a downward again you automatically start sprinting upwards it s so forced to be smooth like why not let me a clumsy spider man who occasionally slams into the side of a building and ragdolls into the environment it d be so funny and give you a better feeling when you nail the stunts correctly,0
now all i want is a ironman game and wanna fly around the city wow i want that,1
knack is back baby,0
i have to ask is this original content,0
so i m suppose to go buy a game that kinda sounds like it s been reviewed by a year old,0
day left,0
pc port soon,0
i do t think so more like a,0
this will be a game i ll rather watch than play,0
all that praise and then you throw in a,0
laura bailey,0
and this is what the creators of batman did for this,0
what about dr connor s class,0
who cares its an exclusive,1
if you haven t played the game yet because it s not out stop being a fanboy crying about it not getting a or,0
hours,0
i don t know how this review made me feel,1
it s like skyrim with spider probably something ign said,0
i m assuming kraven may be the last villain,0
does anybody know if the main story line to this game is about as long as the map of this game,0
okay st thing i love spider man more than anything in this world now my question is where the heck the web attaches to when he does swing kick on roof tops i saw a game play and it s clearly attaching to the sky just check it in you tube itself,0
not as much batman,0
i love your reviews well thought out descriptive without being overly verbose and your commentary and critiques are succinct yet fully realised that makes your narrative and opinion valued and appreciated as well as entertaining i wish i had a ps,0
no matter what the same ad plays every time,0
i had got a ps last black friday for this reason only,0
no online multiplayer what is this spiderman for the ps,0
hours left worst hours in my life,0
loved the game but gave it smh ign typical logic,0
but does it have battle royale mode,0
it really makes you feel like the bomb squad,0
knack remains the best ps game ever made,1
looks fun,0
i m just stoked knowing it wasn t a flop it could have been a buggy mess,0
spiderman for ps really makes you feeeeeellllllllll like batman,0
spoodermins,0
a playstation game lul gr m,0
sasuke as spider man,0
hours,0
lets go i just finished pre ordering spider man,1
damn people are really upset that a game they haven t even played didn t get a the fanboy is strong in this one,1
and so the hr countdown begins,0
from ign safe to say this game is going to be a perfect for me i know where i ll be at friday,0
cheat codes menu type eel nats and your golden unlocks all the dlc,0
why don t you just go and spoil the entire game while your at it,0
wait did he just say hrs,0
i only watch these shitty reviews for gameplay,0
why do i lowkey like the classic suit more than the white blue and red,0
hello everyone im a new gaming youtuber i play all sorts of games from fortnite to rainbow six siege to friday the and many different genres i would appreciate if you guys would check out content on my channel and hit that subscribe button have a nice day,1
sick,0
i m surprised they haven t made spider man a tranz labrador retriever who identifies as a popsicle sony and marvel are pushing the morales character slowly,0
will this come on pc,0
i ll wait until next year s black friday when it s ten bucks,0
sevenwebheads would be proud,0
are we able to play all the rest of the games in the spider man ps i know its a dumb question,0
so the odd pacing dropped it points,1
yuri lowenthal the prince,0
best game of the year,0
it makes you feel like insert superhero name here every review of a marvel dc game ever,1
xbox is better shoulda been xbox exclusive,1
se mamaron le hubieran puesto por lo menos,0
the praise in the review and the score do not line up wtg ign o o,0
was either weed or this gonna get this,0
i just got an ad for this game on this video read more,1
imagine if insomniac made a thor game,0
spoiler alert doctor octopus,0

safe to say arkham city still perfectly balanced as all things should be,0
pros and cons,0
worst review ever come on it is clearly a buggers,0
hours pass,0
spider man spider man does whatever spider does,0
just so you guys know madden got rates higher than this lmao,0
donkey noob skin,0
noob,0
oh crap they added the swing from the amazing spiderman,0
makes you feel like ba spider man,0
this game make me wanna buy ps so much but i just bought switch so cant afford it rn t t,0
games like this one make me realize the power of advertising and hype people are acting like this game offers something so different and greater than the other spider man games it looks better sure but am i blowing a hot load into my pants from what i ve seen from this game as far as gameplay goes absolutely not,1
next up tomb raider,0
doctor octupus is the main villain aunt may dies in the end tombstone and taskmaster are side villains silver sable is introduced but no boss battle with her bosses in order of story are kingpin shocker mr negative electro vulture rhino scorpion mr negative again doc ock miles gets bitten towards the end of the game symbiotes are teased for the next game green goblin is not in it but heavily mentioned peter does not die in this game,0
a bit of an alpha charlie for a b,0
its like skyrim with guns ign spiderman the most innovative game in years ign black ops,0
it almost reminds me of infamous,0
would have rather had a batman beyond game based on the animated series,0
getting beaten by the police makes me feel like a black man,0
excited af,0
hours til release,0
if they had a review code i m fine whit the review but if they played it for days and made this vid i can t except this review,0
nooooo it s only on ps really wow greats game ever but you don t put it on xbox are you serious,0
ign your so dumb you literally said ps doesnt want to cross platform because they have the best server bs it s obviously pc and ps doesnt want to cross platform because their greedy and they are rivals of xbox,0
they should get this peter parker video game model fire little sissy tom holland,0
spider man game makes you feel like batman oh wait,0
xbox has no games,0
i have a ps in my closest collecting dust ok time to get this game,0
love the black and gold suit,0
trash,0
after this game is released they should try to make anothr hulk game or ironman,0
this dickhead ruined the game for me thanks ign,0
fifteen hours i was hoping for maybe or so,0
i see a lot of fellow dunkey fans here hi,0
i m tired of spiderman games just fatigued not gonna play,0
okay so are we just going to ignore the fact that ign gave sunset overdrive a but spider man an,0
not enough puddles ign,1
you lost me at hour adventure thats a sad and small size for a game that costs,0
it really makes you feel like iron man,0
spider man ad lol,0
with the quick time event at the begining i thought it was from the trailer when it was actually gameplay which is just great about this game,0
well yeah ya know this game is for children mainly what did you expect from a spiderman game,0
ya know the great thing about this game is that it really makes you feel like spider man,0
xbox fallon off,0
this has been the longest week of my life,0
i hope venom mysterio sandman green goblin and scorpion are in this game,0
out of not enough emo peter parker,1
who wrote this review,0
i expect a trilogy anyone else,1
loving it only the combat feels not as fun as in ratchet and clank or sunset overdrive but the graphics damn new york is stunning funny to see you giving a to this one and a to their previous work on sunset overdrive even though i prefer sunset for the fun and the jet set radio and ratchet and clank mix,0
jeez get some real reviewers please i m not even goung to repeat the year old review comments mustve made you feel special putting that sheesh,1
,0
wow they hate this game,0

ultimate spiderman is the best though shattered dimensions is some comp,0
comes out on pc looks like a movie with real actors,0
sounds like a watch mojo review,0
spider man makes you feel like batman,1
i can remember playing a spiderman game on computer in like or so,0
all these dislikes are xbox and pc players,1
vr would make this game almost one of the best games to grab on ps,0
spider man ps makes you feel like batman,0
to me it s kind of dumb how they include decimal numbers in these ratings if it s they might as well give it a,0
he sounds like the penguin,0
i like how they complain about this game feeling too familiar to others but every call of duty game is basically the same and they all get praised by ign,0
arkham reskinned,0
a slow spinning redemption what a great dashboard confessional and spider man soundtrack reference,0
fran mirabella has the best hair at ign like if you agree,0

this would be the greatest superhero game ever made if you have the ability to walk in civilian clothes as parker with the option to run into an alleyway to change into your suit,1
gotta say this is a very accurate,0
ign because i prefer dc comics,0
much better then homecoming with holland,0
ohhh wow they gave guacamelee an higher review than this by the way i love guacalmelee they actually gave a lot of indies of late a higher review than spider man,0

spectacular it was a blast makes you feel like spooder man spectacular what a blast here just made a video a little shorter for you,1
this dude sounds like he drinks soy milk,1
,0
why not just more,0
not feeling spider man,0
the game just came out,0
so far i ve seen both ign first instance at and the verge say makes you feel like spider man,0
these reviews are biased and bad plus they just rush through the game and not really caring about it tbh,0
of course i got a spiderman ps ad,1
i don t really approve corporate reviews i ll see for myself friday,0
yeah thanks i ll stick to spiderman two on my playstation,1
to bad i don t got a ps,0
should i get this game or this other game called destiny foreskin that my friend s are talking about,0
still daya for launch on my country,0
avengers infinity war the game confirmed,0
scarlet spider suit looks toight,1
are you sure this guy isn t plagiarizing the review ign,0
hours for open world game wtf pass i ll wait for red dead,1
makes you feel like sounds like ign,0
too bad i don t own a ps,0
but can he do this,0
because not enough puddles,0
happy the tech suit made into the game,0
idk why i m watching this i m on xbox,1
to much shiny skyscrapers huh,0
i m confused dosnt the game come out on friday or something unless it s a demo,0
he is puking when he says spectacular,0
its bad because there are no pizza missions,0
feeeelllll like spidddeerr mannn,0
still an overhyped game reviewer tries to hide repetitive and too long battles and useless side quests,1
this game looks sooooo sick days feels like a millennium,0
why is nobody taking this review seriously,0
thanos car,0
hours,1
better word for feel immersion into character role where did you learn to write,0
ima wait for dunkeys review,0
hours that s not long enough for a triple a game,1
anyone see a lot of just cause in this game webbing people together and the actual movement around the city itself looks like this game just learnt from just cause,0
that points missing is for the puddles,0
how can i bus the thank driver,0
gow still goty,0
spiderman arkham knight,0
looks cool but i know i will get bored after a week of playing,0
dornbush nope,0
i want it nowwww,0
but what about the puddles,0
way to critical dude lay off jackass,0
i want to know is there any guest appearance from other superheroes on this one,0
what company made this game,0
insomnia s spider man makes you feel like batman,0
first time i see that a review is on the trending list,0
oh yes boi,0
dr activist is the final boss,0
though marvel has dominated the film spectrum they fell flat on all other platforms especially video games but this is the exception,0
ign keeps hiring the worst reviewers,1
makes you feel like spiderman,0
spiderman is like the dark souls of feeling like batman and the graphics that s what its all about,0
knack baby,0
lara croft is coming next week,0
why would u spoil the spidey costumes,0
too much arachnids,0
not enough puddles,0
can t wait to walk through the city,0
no it should of been a,0
imagine if they made a daredevil game,0
i love disliking this video because they gave it a and not just a,1
im skiping school for this game,0
pizza time,0
the moment when your so hyped for this game but you remember you have xbox,1
it s you noob i disliked how dare you offend my rights i m a free american man,1
hrs,0
the last spiderman game i played was for ps one of the things i loved about that game was that it encouraged exploration with the side quests and collectibles what optional quests are there outside of the main story in this one,0
spiderman that makes you feel like batman,0
looks like they added some of the best parts of watchdogs with the different gadget attacks and drones,0
we are close to the end of and games still have horrible lip sync and npc interaction gg,0
i just love all these dunkey references,0
what about big wheel c mon you can t have a spider man game without big wheel,1
too many webs,0
this or rdr,0
not fps not gonna watch this one kthxbye,0
and also we need the preview guy as the review guy ign please,0
all i want is a superior spider man suit,1
where is big wheel,0
it makes you feeeeeeel like spider man,0
this is not call of duty,0
you guys are so freaking stuck up i don t believe y all y all have the worst ratings ever every one else is giving it like a and the fact you said great is an understatement,0
the game looks great but hours of gameplay is a joke i would be done with the game in or days make more content and maybe i ll consider spending my money,0
i hope there s a deal on this for blackfriday i m kindda low on funds right now,1
peter parker looks like a mix between andrew garfield and toby maguire,0
fake reviews venom,0
even knack feels like knack,0
seems generous is about right,0
now i wait for dunkey to give it a real review,1
wait is it out,0
they should make a game where you have to survive ebola and you have the same powers as blackwidow or hawkeye,0
where do the webs attach to he moves far too quickly and there looks to be no weight to the character when he s practically flying,0
but does it make you feel like batman i think not,0
the game truly accomplishes the set parameter to make the user come to an emotional level of relatable ness to the main protagonist whom we know as spider man,0
why am i watching this i am a pc guy,0
really,0
not even one minute passes and he said the game really makes you f e e l like spider man,0
wonder should i get this,0
im thumbing down cause its an ign review in general,0
amazing graphics for ps,0
feeeeeeel,0
another overhyped game gonna definetly die soon they need to make more spiderman games when this come out real quick if not then,0
it s basically arkham style combat in a spidey game which is cool,0
makes you feel like spider man you couldn t think of anything else to say that s just lazy writing,0
i feel like spiderman ps will come to xbox almost a lot of exclusives that were in ps came to xbox these xbox people gonna cry and keep crying and then they will definitely bring to xbox and maybe pc,0
hmm gamespot scored higher than ign somethings not right here,0
the guy is probably extremely bad at the game,1
i dont know jonah hill do game review on ign,0
this is a blockbuster weekend rental for me so yeah,0
that review was all over the place i am confused he was saying how much he loved it and then gives it an how do you get a what was the negative about this game,0
thankyou video game lords for putting out a great spider man game,0
marvel s spider man for the ps makes you feel like batman,0
too much webs,0
give me the spider juice,0
does anyone know if there is going to be a sound profile for spiderman for sony playstations gold platinum or headsets,0
reviewed on a ps pro what about us broke knobs who have a regular ps how does this game look can someone do a review pertaining to that,0
is it coming on pc,0
when this game coming out for xb seems legit,0
yeah we get it stop using the same overused unoriginal joke guys thanks,0
maybe they should make a gaming version of the mcu call it the marvel gaming universe with this one setting it off,1
hahaha unplayable,0
this is basically a remastered version to the amazing spider man game for the xbox,0
another rave review by a casual ign editor who s easily impressed,0
it better have the sam raimi costume,0
or straight up no demo at all,0
will there be a demo as it s released on the th,0
it makes u feel like spiderman,0
just another spider man game,0
enough where s angry joe,0
great review tbh,0
too much swinging,0
did he just say avengers tower,0
if tobey maguire come together with tom h for,0
really too bad that this is a ps exclusive would love to play it on pc and with mods from community,0
not enough puddles,0
the puddles were my absolute favorite spider man characters growing up their complex character development in the comics have so much depth and layers and they re very important in the spider man mythos it s great to see the puddles finally the recognition they deserve as they serve a very important role in the overall narrative of the game,0
videogamedunky voice it makes you feel like batman,0
spiderman publisher didn t give enough money to ign,0
stop calling it goty people we all know rdr is goty,0
dam spider man is a killer did you see what he did to xbox,1
okay i get it arkham series still the best superhero game,0
woooow wait only hours or did you guys do it on the easy mode and had a rush in the game,0
i love this game,0
well now i cant play spiderman and be comfortable knowing this game exists,0
remember when cragamerreviews and all xbox owners said this was going to be a terrible game,0
he made it sound like a,0
it s the dark soul of spiderman games,0
no pros cons list on screen very unhappy with this review half great,0
wait is he saying he s played this whole game how,0
if you re an adult and you call bad guys baddies you really need to question what you re doing with your life,0
vindicated i am selfish i am wrong i am right i swear i m right swear i know it all along and i am flawed but i am cleanig up so well i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself did someone else catch the reference,1
makes you feel like spiderman the new makes you feel like batman,0
b np,0
it looks looks like movie,0
pizza time,0
this game makes you feel like batman knack would recommend,1
the batman game got new skins more like,0
easily could ve gave it a,0
so happy that it seems like they took some aspects from the spider man and ganes hope there will be random pop up missions like the games before it,0
only hour eh,0
,0
when will it come out for pc,0
lol it s going to get eventually boring swinging around the city ps user,0
i gotta disagree this game was total trash,0
the amazing spider man on ps is better tbh story and everything,1
is there a home you can enter in the game like do you have a home or apartment,0
please review james pond for the boys,1
so disappointed it s fps on the pro,0
feel like spider man feels like spider man you feel like spider man spider man spider feeeeeeeeels like spi goes insane,0
new suits,0
n o t e n o u g h p u d d l e s,0
hours yeah i ll wait for the bargain bin,0
it s like those ubisoft games of this completed of that collected looks pretty solid though but nothing i would spend money on,0
is anyone else trying to skip the video and looking through the comments to find i fell like spiderman,0
worst review ever,0
not made by nintendo,0
now it just needs to come to xbox,0
ima get madden over this game,0
for me because there was no pizza time,0
a game everybody is hyped for didn t get a or higher that doesn t sound like ign at all,0
this comment section is why i love dunkey,0
makes me feel like batman,0
prototype,0
this review was probably copyrighted,0
physics are too awful for me,0
too icky,1
meh filip miucins review would ve been better,0
cool everyone is rating it between an and a pretty much what i was expecting and hoping for sounds like the best super hero game since arkham city,0
this is just their opinion and what they thought of the game who cares if they enjoyed other games more than they enjoyed spider man and ranked them higher it s crazy how many people are butt hurt over a simple opinion just because it isn t what they wanted to hear not to mention that the majority of you haven t even played the game yet,0
omfg they actually used the makes you feel like spider man line in the first seconds,0
sick review glad it s not,0
geez pretty harsh review for a beautifully crafted game,0
dang this on the ps pro thought it was a ps game lol,0
too much open world,0
just pre ordered this,0
yea because pete an mj are why people want to play barf,0
they couldn t just give it a instead of,0
million views in less than hours you know the pre order numbers are high,0
hours too little,0
wait the story is only hours long,0
so it s a sandbox game,0
this game really makes you feel like batman,0
this game makes you feel like batman,0
be funny if alex mercer showed up,0
everything was great except a tiny annoyance eh let s just call it,0
soooo an updated spider man,0
spider man makes me feel like batman,0
it really makes you feel like spider pig spider pig,0
i was expecting at least a but can t really expect much from the people who gave the witcher a,0
dis spiderman has organic webs,0
looks like dunkey was right about this one,0
everyone talking bout how this game makes you feel like batman i felt like knack babyyyyyy,0
thanks to dunky all i heard was makes you feel like spiderman,0
m a k e s y o u f e e l l i k e b a t m a n,0
not enough puddles,0
just wondering can you switch between spiderman and peter parker or are you spider man through the whole game,0
is the statue of liberty in the game or have they forgot to add it it would be very silly not to include the most famous landmark of new york,0
i very surprised about graphics i m sorry to speak english is difficult lol,0
it makes you feel like,0
only kids who play fortnite like this little kid game,0
spiderman arkham city,0
you have shocker but no mysterio or vulture,0
this guy is nitpicking too much,0
the fact that you can t swing from helicopters or to the statue of liberty justifies the score,0
please help me get a new laptop,0
this is piderman,0
it makes me feel like spider man this just feels like every arkham review ever where they say that the games make you feel like batman,0
downgrade man,0
i m so excited,0
insomniac needs to make an iron man game now,1
tbh never trust ign s reviews,0
don t forget about all the dlc they have planned for this it may make the overall story feel more complete plus more villians,0
did he say hr tf,0
wait till dunkey sees this you really feel like spiderman,0
goooo,0
it hurts me how many bad jokes are in this comment section,0
is the verdict if u wanna skip the whole thing is the number score,0
two words f i l i p m i u c i n,0
and when a cod review comes in gets a,1
too much buildings,0
so wait until it s on sale got it,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
i don t get the score aside from like two gripes you gush about the game constantly talking about how you feel like spider man yet it s an by what metric does anyone subtract from the score,0
not bad at all,0
too much web,0
the web swinging alone makes it a,1
madden got a higher score than this let that sink in people ign is a joke,1
can play ps slim,1
just finished it today out of wait for a sale,0
not bad at all can t wait to try it for myself well technically i ve been waiting for about years but you know that i mean,0
anyone wanna buy me a ps thanks,0
pls subscribe watch pls support me i need yours,1
this reviewer sounds like a year old peter parker,1
great narration bro,0
got the deluxe edition,1
that is not spider man that s young bruce wayne dressed as spiderman it is so similar to the arkham series,0
after listening to the review this game very much sounds like a batman arkham game but with a bigger world and it s spider man themed,0
feel like spider man,0
can you put dirt in people s eyes,1
really makes you feel like spiderman,0
ummmm why not just give it a,0
i thought the moving eyes were removed from the downgrade,1
,0
makes you feel like spiderman ign k you d never let me down hahahaha,0
yeah but does it make you feel like spider man,0
bruh do people actually take ign reviews serious,0
can t wait to play it this friday,0
looks brilliant shame i cant afford a ps pro and also an xbox one for forza,0
sounds to me like you d prefer the boss battles to be unpredictable basically when you re fighting the big bad he should be able to adapt and learn while in mid battle against you that s one way to make this game and all the others interesting by taking out the patterns to defeat your enemy it would feel like real life for those wanting to know what it s like to be in the front lines of an actual battle cause in the real world there are no patterns,0
anyone else gunna use the iron spider suit,0
as an xbox owner i might buy a ps just to play this game,0
i have a pc xbox and switch,0
so basically enemies are too weak,1
it makes you feel like batman,0
the game makes you feel like spider man,0
i rather play rdr,0
tbh it s fine i got it early,0
black ops,0
skreeching yaaaaaaaaaaaaaad,0
snap,0
so this game is not on the xbox console,0
how did madden get a better rating then spider man that s how you know ign reviews are terrible,0
this makes me wet the floor,1
ever since ign gave gta a i never trust them,0
i m trusting you ign,0
a hour game for bucks nah i ll pick this up in a couple of months once it s bucks,1

is manhattan the only borough in the game or is this guy just dumb,0

it makes u feel like spiderman,0
needs more pictures of spiderman,0
don t know why i watched this makes no difference if this dude liked it or not,0
it really make y u f el like spinederpman,0

this game made a marine staff sergeant cry it s the best please buy it,1
you ever wish you were comment famous but no one ever pays attention to you,0
smash ultimate is probably going to be,0
this guy sounds like he needs a drink,0
wow a review more then mins on ign you guys finally did it,0
i can t believe it spider man got come on they should to give him or is a great great game i don t understand what happened to ign come on lol,0
they definitely said this game makes you feel like spider man on purpose because of the dunkey meme,0
i pee on u now,0
damn i had it coming in at at least a minimum i guess ign review scores only matter when it s a xbox game,1
i really wanted them to say that it really makes you feel like batm i mean spider man,0
not enough big wheel,0
can t wait this game will masterpiece,0
so exited for the game feel that its going to be amazing but no as mucho as the arkaham games from batman,0
too much puddle,0
does the game have a custom engine to combine different spider suits to your own choices etc s,0
yay xbox can t get it,0

hope your playing that game johnathan,0
is this game going to be available for xbox one if yes when,1
spider man hours of content that seems low,0
is a great score and the dude had arguments to justify it people need to stop bitching every time,0
i just hope this doing well encourages them to make other marvel video games,0
there is a hot chick in the game best game ever,0
dude the reviewer sounds like peter parker himself,1
it makes you feel like spider man huh,0
really from all the wows and greats i thought they ll give it a or more,0

the review sounded more than but okay,0
mj looks so plain i guess non sexy women are the standard now for western games,0
this game is soo perfect,0
is there a channel with a real reviewer,0
yep it was downgraded that demo must have been on the xb x,0
make you feel like spiderman,0
dear ign is it possible to record everything in the game without getting blocked scenes i mean like the end of arkham knight or everything in person you can t record so i wanna know if there are anything like that cause i wanna record the game,0
man the only thing that could be better then this is if insomniac made a venom game that would be epic,0
downgrade lighting looks low quality low resolution textures used ps can t handle,0
i can t buy this i am afraid of heights,0
is like having roblox as an exclusive what a retard d shithole of a game,0
makes you feel like spider man that sounds somewhat familiar,0
,0
spider man makes me fee like a batman,0
sighs might be knitpicking i hate how in these ps reviews they always make you feel like your not getting the full experience if your not playing it on ps pro like not everyone has a k tv or wants to spend more money on a console they already own im sorry i dont wanna complain but i hate when reviewers do that ok rant over,0
where does the go,0
too many buildings,0
i think hes trying to say that this game really makes you feel like spiderman,1
i d rate it,0
next time keep spoilers out of your videos or straight up warn us you didn t need to show the suits or speak so much on the story most of us are getting the game and come on here to see how the game controlled and what they had fixed over the month,0
where is gwen,0
wtf after all this predominantly positive comments it only got a,0
its been too long since i ve played a decent spiderman game,0
makes you feel like batman,0
makes you feel like spider man lmfao dunkey was right about these reviews,1
why score so low not spider man fans,0

not enough spiders,0
i m born and raise in new york moved to vegas yrs ago if i could be spider i d move back,0
is this copyed,0
he just said batman ark asylum is a methodical thrill,1
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
it would be cool to freely walk around the city as peter parker and interact with the environment go inside businesses and interact with random people,0
i don t understand why ign feels that they need to come up with odd scores when reviewing games just round the score to a or a seriously is a or a that much of a difference lol i don t know maybe it is just me but i just don t understand these odd number scores ign has been doing with their reviews lately lol,0
oh boy you are so thrifty just give it a,0
i can t wait to get my hands on this game,0
f e e l s liike spiderman,0
hours lol,0
just me and you spiderman,0

i wish ign would die off,0
soooooo is hobgoblin the last member of the sinister six,0
repetitive missions and underwhelming boss fights wtf,0
insomniac just makes you feel like spider man ign,0
wtf does even mean,0
it wouldve been cool if they brought back bruce campbell as the tutorial narrator,0
doc ock is the main,1
another ign spoiler filled review,0

spiderman,0
if the rami suit is in the game the power will be crying,0

slow spinning redemption a reference to vindicated by dashboard confessional from the spider man soundtrack,0
my only hope for this game is that it really makes you feel like batman,1
before mill,0
omg i want it,0
lol the whole review presents the game without faults and then at the end just throw in the real quick things you don t like and give it a fantastic score come on,0

spiderman really makes you feel like batman,0

im jealous i want it now smashes everything in living room,0
do you actually get to have a boss fight with task master do we actually get to see him or is it just a bunch of tests by him,0
i knew why hype wasnt for nothing,0
gotta be batman son playing,0
looks bland and uninspired completely unrealistic movement physics stealth gameplay this isn t batman y all and repetitious side mission and collectible based gameplay,0
i canceled my preorder content completely finished scrapped out of the game to resell it to us in a timely season pass unbelievable no thanks,0
on insomniac games twitter they have retweeted almost every professional review of the game except ign s,0

looks like spider man game just better graphics i remember playing the game on gamecube for hours trying to complete every challenge and buy every upgrade just hours swinging around the city like the reviewer said,1
i just want the game already,0
spidey web of shadows different endings complex fighting mechanics player choice that affects the ending spiderman batman arkham clone button mashing linear story wow true next gen experience my a lol,1
check it,0
now who s the goty,0
this game is the boss of games whether you like it or not so you may as well get used to it i m directing this message to everyone btw not only to ign,0
makes you really feel like spiderman,0
ign s review is really lazy go check out easy allie s review they used to be gametrailers,1
already pre order,1
could not look or feel more spider man,0
wait isnt the voice actor of spidey the same as ben from ben the one where he is grown up,0
no plasma rifle,0
what happens if u dive from a building but dont use your web amd hit the ground does spidermang catch damage,0
it really makes you feel like bookworm adventures deluxe,0
ign stop with the dumb copout decimals u should know by now we all just round that to the nearest anyway therefore its a,0
really makes you feel like spider man,0
i wanted to feel like spiderbat but i was surprised how much i liked bruce parker,0
wait it s out,0
too much puddles,0
one quick note never trust ign reviews like ever,1
aside from the side missions does this game have mini beat em up challenges with the henchmen like the batman arkham games,0
he s in boys he did it he said it airhorns,1
that pop in tho fire escape stairs on left,0
the cinematics looked like sims tbh,0
question for yall this is insomniacs view on spiderman but how do y all think rocksteady would ve done you guys think they would ve gave this game justice,0
puddles too small,1

slow spinning redemption well played,0
if this gets a pc release i ll donate to chatity,0
can t come soon enough so excited to play this game,0
ign ur trash for this,0
according to ign cod spider man money truly does talk also not bashing spider man just implying that cod needs to be knocked down a few pegs and that ign s reviews are inconsistent at best,0
only questions i have are there any trailing missions is big wheel the mastermind behind everything no to either of these is a no go,0
does anybody know if gamestop doing a midnight release,0
expected nothing but dunky fans was not dissapointed,0
literally got an ad of this game on this video,0
its september more days till its out i preordered it and im sooooo hypeeeeeee screeeeeeeeeeeeee,0
hours seems a little short imo,0
the feels,0
man the amount of times this guy says feels or nearly,0
add another ps exclusive to the list,1
more pie please,0
batman arkham this crap,0
most of the complaints are just you problems if you want a challenge make it yourself,1
xbox only players trying to not think about this lmao preordered so hyped,1
if only this was on xbox,1
y all still don t have mw tho,0
at least a come one ign,0

all of the dislikes are xbox gamers,0
dashboard confessional vindicated easter egg,0
game of the year,0
so you don t have too play as marryjane in the story mode for hrs,0
i think this was a fair review i heard the games story combat and exploration are fantastic but the open world and side objectives are meh so to me that is a out of what else did you expect or are you just making typical ign jokes,1
man this review made me really feeeel like an ign reporter,0
too much puddles,0
not even puddles,0
too many feels,0
this game really makes you feel like batman this game really makes you feel like spiderman,0

a robot could review insert joke,0
laura bailey she is a fantastic voice actress great choice insomniac,0

your welcome,0
i can see it now superman x lucina from smash i say smash because casuals don t know what a fire emblem even is,0
don t read my name,0
now we need an ironman game with the same engine or maybe superman,0
anyone know if there s a hud off mode i hate it when games always have white highlights around the enemies and those circles on every building are annoying as well i want it to look like a movie,0
this game makes me feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel like i have a sense of feeling you feel me,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,1
laura bailey doing mj was a great choice,0
this game made me feel like thanos,0
so sony deliver it once again thank u insomniac n thank u sony for this amazing game looks like it,0
too bad it s a ps exclusive,0
really makes me feel like spider man,0
i have a very serious question for playstation gamers how come most homosexuals prefer the playststion over the xbox console why do most heterosexuals prefer the xbox,0
spider man may be fun but bop it is miles better come to my channel,0
if it s too easy it s bad if it s too hard it s bad will this whiners ever be satisfied,0

i hope one day they make a spidey game with miles morales,0

nobody asks how spiderman feels,0
this game makes you feel like batman,0
what i would have given at lest,0
before i watch this can someone tell me if they actually beat the game before making this review,1
when your teacher doesn t round up your to a,0

,1
that review was perfectly balanced as all things should be,0
not enough pizza time,1
i will give my honest opinion about this video game after i see the video,1
idk why everone is hyped about playing as peter parker if i wanted to be a broke out of college nerd in their s i can just be myself,0
ign gave this game because they don t want to dethrone spider man as their best spidey game which had a,0
whats with the decimal scores u numbnuts,0
makes you feel like batman,0
the guy sounds like he has a stuffy nose,1
to be honest i expect this game to be a pretty much updated version of spider man based off the riami film game from years ago if so then thats ok cause i had heaps of fun with that game so i am definitely looking forward to this game,0
who will fortnite or smash,0
this game really makes you feel like spider man,0
this game makes you feel like spider man,0
already pre ordered,0
makes me f e e l like spooder,0
who remembers when there was multiplayer before online multiplayer,0

too much press on right time a right key battles,0
what i like about this game is that it makes me feel like spiderman,0
i hope xbox guys are watching this,0

here s my review to ign,0
is this game gonna come out for xbox one,0
how about for xbox,0
this guy sounds like peter parker,1
the webbing is the wrong shade of white,0
shadow of the tomb raider will get a better score or better,0
reminds me of the spare a square scene from seinfeld you really couldn t spare points and make it an even,0
say raimi trilogy homecoming change my mind,0
can t wait to emulate this,0
seems like a fair review from what i saw seems more like material nothing more doesn t seem to worthy of anything higher definitely cool though and as i ve been a major fan of spiderman for the past years definitely a pick up,0
definitely gonna pick it up the th this friday i didn t pre order who does anyway especially when we hit year,0
i m excited for this game like hella excited but hours that s pretty short but i m still hype,0
i am just guessing here but i think doctor octopus is he s mentor,1

am more excited to play in the original costume than any other one it looks so clean and classic,0
non suit peter looks bad,0
it really makes you feel like spider man,0
he legit just went through the tree,1
can you use the sam raimi spiderman suit in this game,0
he makes it sound a lot longer then hours,0
the repetitive mechanics kills the score rating that s why it only has he did mentioned repetitive times,0
man this game really made me feel like batman i mean spider man,0
this game makes you feel like batman,0
is technically a,0
really makes you feel like batman,0
this and gow are the only games that tempt me to buy a ps,0

really makes you feel like spider man,0
is it just me or does peter look like a young nathan drake,0
i cant wait for this game,0
too much spider not much man,1
ign score in the future,0
oh look at he boat on the left pop in,0
predator concrete jungle anyone,0
i give this game a because i haven t played enough of the game to get the full experience that is needed when i play the game maybe i ll change the rating but for now i m just gonna leave it at that great looking game though insomniac did an awsome job and i m looking forward to seeing them pop up again in an interview where they review their next game and i think they should make a new daredevil game that s set in this game s universe,0
this is better than arkham knight and that game got a so how in the red hot hell does this game get a ign how sway how,0
dat pop in boat tho,1
well i dont care about the rating i m buying this no matter what bc spidey boi,0
feel like spider man,0
greatest video ever i loved it it is super mega legit awsome the best super cool,0
man how are you going to praise the pacing and thanking them for showing restraint but bash the pacing in the end of the video wtf,0
mary janes va is kairi s va from kingdom hearts there goes my,0
swinging and gliding through the air is just like batman swinging with the batclaw and he glides fighting the bad guys is just like batman with the combos totally a batman clone,1
i thought ign would give it or,0
needs more puddles,0
i need money,0
who ever says out of has down syndrome,1
damn he didn t waste time i thought it d take at least a minute,0
peter pecker,0
too much spider not enough call of duty,0
i can feel like a cop when driving fast eating donuts and shooting a gun but how do you feel like spiderman by swing on vines in a jungle crawl up walls i never felt like spiderman but this review does maybe he s spiderman nah it s just dumb ign telling people that so there dumbasss website gets more traffic dunk,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
makes you really feel like batman,0
it s nice to finally see an original review again from ign,0
no pc,0
laura bailey as in nadine from uncharted who for some reason sounds more like ashley johnson ellie in this game,0
this is why i hate having an xbox,0
too much buildings,1
but can we play as miles morales,0
it really makes you feel like spiderman,0
so fortnite gets a right spiderman must be better right nope w t f,0
all you ps fan boys are mad it got and not a like gamespot lol just look at the dislikes haha i feel this is a more honest review tbh and most reviews are biased af towards ps exclusives any ps exclusive automatically gets a or it s all those kick backs,0
this one was a long one lol,1
wheres that yo kai watch blasters review at ign,0
it s better than the amazing spider man games,0
m a k e y o u f e e l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0
i m so excited,0
not enough actual spiders in the game,0
marvels spider man on ps makes you really feel like spider man,0
the fluid movement reminds me of sunset overdrive,1
plz watch my vids and consider subbing yeet,0
fortnite spider man ps please end me,0
the facial animation looks amazing,0
do u get the entire dlc if u get the digital deluxe or not,1
i m done with ign this game is literally amazing it deserves a,0
i knew it same old game over and over lmao pass,0
better than xbox exclusives,0
why do they always release badass games when school starts,0
this game looks awesome i love watching the web slinging it looks so fun this game reminds me of the original spider man movies with toby maguire i love it,0
the review sounded more like a out of score and your score didn t match what you actually expressed about the game,1
really makes you feel like batman,1
feel like batman feel like spiderman,1
so no downgrade,0
who s gonna get this,1
this game probably would have broken a record if it was multiplatform,0
not enough buildings,1
,1
it really makes you f e e l like spider man,0
i don t have a ps buttttttttt that may change see this,0
if you round you have a,0
me amazing spiderman was better,0
too bad a dlc was already announced and the game isn t even out yet,0
honestly based on the pros listed on this review i expected a higher ranking for this game like a solid,0
i give it a you really feel like spider man out of,0
your lips are too wet,0
it makes you feel like spider man,0
game of the year nuff said,0
wait a minute call of duty infinite warfare marvel s spider man wtf ign,0

either way it all just ends to everyone s preference on the game lol as long as i like it then that s all that matters to me haha,0
that s it im buying a ps now dammit,0
if don t get to wear the maguire suit this gets a,0
the countdown starts now,0
the final verdict doesn t really math up with the review at all the whole time he s praising the hell out of it and when he does say something negative he either doesn t elaborate or makes it seem like a small nitpick,0
the dislikes are from xbox fanbois who complained about the puddles,0
all them dislikes xbox players,0
saying insomniac as many times as possible simulator,0
never trust an ign review or score like one i heard from p e s i m still looking for a game called p e s,0
how many times is he going to use the words makes me feel like spiderman,0
you explained it well spiderman deserved it,0
this video made me feel like batman,0
to be honest the arkham games will never be beaten,0
can you thank the bus driver tho,1
i don t like who is talking cause he slurs every single word and hard to understand like the venom commercial,0
wheres my puddle,0
spider man makes me feel like a human being holding a controller while playing a video game,1
dunkey s gonna have a fuckin field day with this,0
somebody s got to be working on a ps emulator for pc,0
really makes you feel like batman spiderman i mean spiderman,0
ummmm hour adventure what did u do play on super easy mode and skip all cutscenes,0
for kids don t bother buying this bullshit,1
i d love to see a review that wasn t bought guess i ll wait until the embargo is lifted shocking eh still have an embargo on reviews even though reviews are released,0
wow well this was a harsh review despite the great action the thrilling sense of feeling like spiderman the relationship between mj and pete is one of the best in games and its not even the solid rough ign that s rough,0
hours,0
too much webslinging,0
too much wat webs,0
they forgot to bring big wheel,1
i m throwing money at the screen but nothing s happening,0
disappointment level is critical systems crashing i was just learning how to love,0
i feel like you don t know what you are talking about with front and back end loaded boss fights,0
sub to me comment done and ill do the same,0
gameplay looks sick in this vid,0
spectacular spectacular,0
this better be the next webs of shawdows,0
what i take from this is raise the difficulty and take your time on the game end result winner,0
no pizza time,0
goty,0
freakin days more,0
no pizza delivering,0
yeees prove ea wrong,0
idk care what kindof score they gave it i m excited to play this nonstop,0
easy allies review is better,1

sounded like a to me when imperfect games get a for other reasons why knock this down by,1
lol why is this trending,0
dlc will make it a if they do it like batman,0
are you guys high you couldnt have said or hell this deserves a,0
how come everyone else says hours worth of game play and ign says,0

i ve been playing spider games on xbox can t believe it s only on ps,0
too much web swinging,0
damn why is it ps only,0
i hate how spiderman does the same backwards look animation everytime he swings or so it seems couldn t they have switched up the animation a bit,0
y all couldn t just round up to,0
was it spiderman that was the amazing game the combat,0
i just want instant kill mode,1

not enough kids losing their baloons,0
in my opinion,0
,0
i can t believe he referenced dunkey,0

ea take a note i m buying this game over your games,0
i can t wait,0
unpopular opinion,0
too many puddles,0
tomb raider will be better get hyped,0
to feel like spider man,0

i want a tom holland review of this,1
we all know peter parker is gonna die,0
u have to be able to deliver pizza,0
could not look or feel more like batman,0

wish this game will release on pc,0
i wonder if the december dlc will have a christmas theme and have the city draped in snow,0
oh look puddles,0
,0
it s normal,0
too much spider man,1
can t wait to get this game my favorite before this was ultimate spider man despite it s short story,0
nice cant wait when it releases on xbox,1
quick cuts or frame stutters,0
no inverted takedown and batarangs,0
what ratchet and clank is points higher,0
man this is going to be all time epic,0
man playstation is on a role,0
spider man talking to a random guy on the street random guy casual talk with a superhero me makes me feel like random guy,0
i wish i had a ps,0
oh hi mark,0
ign rated madden above this game,0
ign is trash,0
xbots now i lay my box to rest,0
worst review ever,0
what about the puddles,0
you re mom,1
by the way he talked it seems more like a,0
is this an ad for the game,0
what we need now is a similliar avengers x men game,0
i feel it deserves at least,0
xbox is better hahahahah,0
as a xbox fan boy i m so ashame seeing this sony listens and delivers to their fans,0
mj ellie,0
who is peter parker probably not important,0
no eminem kamikaze,0
it s amazing,0
kingpin moving like a bloody ballerina lol,0
review sounded like a to me tbh,0
no v bucks,0
mary jane lookin like something outta mass effect andromeda,0
no man is actually a spider,0
does it have multiplayer,0
cant wait rdr teaches this kiddo game,0
so ditkovich finally got his rent and evicted peter oh boy yeah,0
i dont understand why people still care about the score at the end of the video igns scores are all arbitrary and are held to no particular scale just move on to a different video as soon as he finishes his synopsis and analysis,0
spider man is that you,0
spider bot,0
no post credit scene,0
looks worth bucks,0
lmao,0
rocksteady needs to release it s superman game already and then hopefully batman beyond,0
not enough spiderpig,0
release a pc version of the game with all the new tech stuff from nvidia rtx videos cards,0
campaign is too long,0
really makes you feel like batman,0
is it just me or is peter parker doing this review,0
not enough webs,0
goty,0
too much hype behind it that real reviews aren t going to come out there just going to try and appease fans glad they were honest here,1
too much spider not enough man,0
ehhh gonna pass was hoping for a cohesive and compelling story and multiple reviews are just showing that it won t give that to me not saying it seems bad but just not for me open world spider slinging looks to get old somewhat quickly if there isnt a great story pushing me forward but that s just my horrible opinion edit also that lipsyncing and animation just screams basic rushed motion capture nine times out of ten,1
change the score it s a,0
round it to,0
when you don t have ps,0

to much arkham not enough city,0
if ign gives k a higher score than this i m officially done with ign edit to be clear nba k not wwe k,1
too much spider man,0

sticky note says call t s back re job offer,0
this suit looks amazing does not disappoint my expectations,0
wow typical bullshit ign score unbelievable,0
this has been an incredible year to be a ps owner,0
bump that score up bro,0
i love how game devs said under suits when clearly you can see there are it s not that hard to count guys,0
not enough puddles,0
i think no super hero game will never be able to touch batman arkham series,0
punisher game next or dead,1
come on now give it at least a,0
it really makes you feel like batman,0
could have been maybe just the hype train but i feel a little low,0
its really makes you feel like batman oh wait wrong game,0

this game makes you feel like batman you really feel like batman arkham city makes you feel like the caped crusader himself,1
how many villains are in the game,0
plagiarised,0
who is the secret character,0
why no cc for us deaf people,0
so it did it it surpassed spiderman ps,0
where does the come from seriously just give it a,0
i wonder if gwen stacy is in this game,0
did the check from insomniac bounce or something,0
spider man makes you feel like spider man,1
wtf that last score killed it like always,1
needs a this guy is bad at reviewing,0
i didn t like the review he should ve went with the pros first and later with the cons it avoids giving you mixed feelings,0
am i the only one who predicts a new official trailer for into the spider verse this friday when the game comes out,1
did he say only hours of game play,0
ship pops up,1
what s next for insomniac s take on the marvel universe a standalone iron man adventure,0
hate the fact that when you fall you won t get hurt like wtf,0
isn t the last villain doctor octopus,0
hope dangles on a string,0
don t like the fact that the game has some of the same bullshit that s already gotten so tired and repetitive in open worlds that even ubisoft tried to change it up a bit with farcry i would have liked more side missions and literally anything other than clear this base or climb that tower that sounds like a game that will get old real fast once the main missions are done i was gonna get the ps for this game but i think i ll wait for a price drop hopefully by christmas,1
don t you hate it when someone doesn t finish their read more,0
this game blacopy paste,0
too little puddles,1
just lost respect for ign,0
yall put too many spoilers in this,0
september th say goodbye to my school grades,1
batman is they best superhero game ever all now spidey shines cant wait to play,0

from ign i ll accept that i m even more excited to play it i don t remember the last time a spider man game was given higher than a,0
me cries in xbox it s call cool though i think omg raider will fill the void pretty nicely,0
not a nintendo game,0

yosuke and rise lul,0

ign no puddles,0
does this game require internet,0
xbox users smashing that thumbs down button lmaooooo,0
spiderman arkham,0
im going to play this for myself as soon as i get my hands on it so excited,0
don t let this distract you from the fact that the warriors blew a lead,0
did you just say boss battles become repetitive pattern recognition that is what boss fights are since the dawn of games imagine the frustration if the boss kept giving diferent attacks and kill you over and over and over,0
i d be depressed if i had an xbox one right now,0
i will cry myself to sleep every night thinking about this game not being on pc,0
this game looks great but looks like gow wins game of the year until red dead comes out,0
hour,0
i feel like i m spending more time just swinging around in this game,0
hour campaign lmao,0
arkham city really makes you feel like batman,0
f e e l l i k e s p i d e r m a n,0

call t s for job offer huh,0
does anyone actually trust ign reviews,1
hyyyyyyypeeedddddd,0
should ve added battle royale,0
how does it make you feel like spider man,0
having a multiplayer player option where players can play as villains and heroes tearing up the city and fighting each other would have made this a,1
take that off cause this game had a learning curve but whey,0
i want prototype,0
downgraded and cod ghosts got a higher score,0
let the xbox and pc begging race begin,0
nonstop praise what i dont care that he gave it that score at all but at least reflect it in the review,0
hour adventure that s not a lot,0
so mj and peter are not together from what you showed in the end,0
and people said spider man will be better than batman arkham looks who s laughing now this game got a while batman aa and ac got above look guys i will buy this game but i just don t think it s better than batman arkham,1
made me feel like sexual predator,0
but that venom mission tho,0
man i thought it was spiderman talking at the beginning,0
the voice actress who plays mj sounds like she s doing a kirsten dunst impression,0
i had no idea laura bailey was in this game that s little trunks and shin chan right there,0
as i was afraid its just amazing spiderman with better graphics and repetitive as hell,1
not enough web,0
laura bailey is in this pre ordered,0
i m excited about this videogame,0
made me feel like batman,0
you re welcome,1
i pre ordered it but i cant play it,0
all the dislikes are xbox users,1
i wish spider man looked like tom holland but was still a more experienced spider man,0
downgrade grafis stil amazing,0
hope they make a second or third or fourth,0
olaf from frozen doing reviews for ign now,0
this will be epic on my xbox one x can t wait for friday,0
too much pizza not enough time,0
don t let it shock you ign doesn t believe in even numbers odd number,0
show us avengers tower,0
spiiiderrwussssss,0
i hope they make peter parker playable as spider man,1
makes you feel like spider man deja vu anyone,0
they have outposts focusing right on stealth,0
but does it make you feel like batman,0
videogamedunkey was right every reviewer of a popular game company will always say makes me feel like,0
why fps though,0
too much webs,0
sooooo graphical downgrade or not,0
not enough puddles,0
i like turtles,1
all i need to know is if it makes me feel like spider man,0
call of doodoo no story but great shooting mechanics,0
how many gigs,0
wait it s out,0
anything above a is worth playing in my opinion,1
howd u get the game early,0
calling it now this and rdr will lose out to gow in the goty awards,0
the voice of ben and sasuke uchiha is playing peter parker,0
i got a spiderman ps ad,0
dayum graphics fell harder than the twin towers,0
it s a ok game,0
makes you feel eerily like batman,0
to many webs,1
fridaaaay please comeee fasteeer,0
not that amazing,0
i am so damn upset this isn t coming to xbox,0
arkham knight is so much better,0
this is spiderman arkham,0
feel like spiderman intensifies,0
imagine if your last name was dornbush,0
when i saw you could play as homecoming spider man i audibly squealed this ll probably be one of the first games i ll actually play a lot of on my ps i ve only really played unravel and injustice and journey,0
spiderman is not batman,0
can t believe we re now really really close to finally playing spider man the year wait is almost over,1
where my pre ordered boys at,0
no superhero game better than batman,0
i think i ll wait for filip s review,0
ok so first you criticized the fact that the game don t have enough bosses then said that you re happy they restrained themselves of showing bosses too often xd i m just nitpicking anyways i m definetly buying it next week can t wait,0
qte boss fights,0
no uncle ben suit,0
spiderman is a dude you trippin this is the most greatest spiderman game n its not all about spidy peter s there also you learn about his life no other spiderman has done this so in depth like this,0
pc for the best graphics ps for the phenomenal exclusives switch for the phenomenal exclusives that you can make portable xbox one s if you want a k player that can play video games on the side,1
did he say laura bailey,0
iink to original,0
we need more voice actors in the industry,1
things don t have to be relatable to be amazing,1
too much web swinging,0
xbox fan here and i want this game best superhero game so ill try to pick it up,0
he almost said there s a learning curve as if its a bad thing,1
seems they got an rpg player to review this he wanted the game to feel spider man by having more peter and mj moments,0
when ign gives spider man ps a lower score than madden,1
art style on villains is hideous,0
so many puns,0
looks like spidey reviewing his own game totally bias if u ask me,0
ign is seriously the most awkward with reviewing been plowing through this for a couple of hours not even a superhero kinda guy but this game is more then a lol bunch of hipsters working at ign haha,0
sometimes it s better to play and enjoy the game by yourself and make your own judgement based on your experience rather than listening to other people s opinion so don t blame on him if you don t agree with his point of view,0
can the dlcs be playing as or with different marvel characters that show up needing help with quests missions,0
too much spider not much man,0
hours that s like days worth of gameplay,0
but does it make you feel like batman,0
ok psfanboys let s ask them why not a,0
i can t wait for this beautiful game,0
game of the year,0
i feel bad for all the console gamers who will have to play in fps while us pc gamers will enjoy this game in smooth fps must feel bad for anyone who had a peasant ps,0
gollee i can t wait till friday,0
just a survey batman arkham knight on p c vs spider man on p s which one do you think wins before you answer consider the following cases graphic overall look game play sound tracks main villains and also consider the final version of the game not the buggy first version thank you for you answer,0
wheres the goddamn raimi suit,1
lets make a petition to microsoft to make spiderman and ultimate spiderman backward compatible on xbox one they deserve that at least,0
next marvels daredevil game please,0
don t think this game will get game of the year but it looks amazing see what i did there btw this is coming from an xbox player,0
too much spider,0
seems a little to reliant on arkham and quick time events very underwhelming open world which acts more a something to do between story i was hoping for a revolutionised spider man game and they ve literally just made more amazing spider man instead,0
if you think is a bad score ask yourself if you would be mad if you got an on any test during high school if the answer is no stop complaining and just appreciate the game,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
pizza time,0
yeah i d rather the backpacks didn t show an obvious glowing icon,0
too much spider not enough man,0
cant wait,0
not hours,0
definitely with all his talk sounds like a,0
i cant wait,0
batman games have drama he feels pain when u watch batman movie he is always carachter with issues and just pain so its better see him watching playing his games idk batman is the most famous for that reason,0
this game comes out on my birthday leave a like,0
too much new york city,0
we are in the making of another classic,1
fantastic review,0
it really makes you feel like spider man,0
i knew insomniac didnt have what it takes to make a and above game,0
ahem gow ahem,0
too much webs,0
feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like spiderman feel like batman feel like batman,0
wow all the spoilers and sneak peaks,0
if insomniac doesn t create a sequel you ll never see a better game than this,0
wtf due to pacing issues you don t deserve to rate this game thats so bull you subtracted points due to pacing,0
ign always hating,0
did you just,1
listening to u i expected a why is it an pacing,0
oh ok so you craft the suits by earning tokens,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
the pop in looks horrendous,1
completion on the suit screen and he had suits does this mean there are suits,0
they literally lost huge amount of money by not releasing this on pc,0
why is afraid of because,0
hey this review sounds like the same one i made on my channel,0
this will easily be the second best game of the year,0
i feel like if this was halo it would be a,0
huh funny cause at sdcc ign said this is the best spider man game ever made lol how time changes things,0
can you wait a few weeks after the games been released all over the world before giving a negative review ffs ign it hasn t been released in australia yet and now my expectations are a bit flat,0
i m just buying the game so i can distress by swinging around nyc,0
this deserves a,0
yep imma stream it on twitch,0
this game better have unlimited enemies and radiant quests so it never gets dull,0
so it s not quite game of the year but close i ll take it but is tony stark in it,0
feels for all you dunkey fans,1
yall should ve given it a,0
what the hell literally said the game made him feel like spiderman proceeds to give the game an this guy is on something,0
just give it a jesus christ,0
really is a bad score now yeezus stop being so salty not every review has to be yay or nay okay,0
spider man game is my favorite spider man game i have been waiting for something like this for some time people don t acknowledge the fact that peter is as important as spider man story wise i think this game shows that sadly won t be able to play this game for a while nonetheless am pumped,0
another forgettable spiderman game,1
this is how you review,0
sigh bad review from ign,1
surprise surprise sony has another great exclusive,0
regardless can t wait till friday first of the big exclusives,0
bad verdict i digress,0
seriously couldn t round it to a,0
omg kingpin and spider man boss battle looks amazing can t wait to play it i m so hype,0
tom holland spiderman,0
sony s new spider man on ps really makes you feel like spider man,0
repetitive boss battles i can spend hours swinging through the city makes you feel like spiderman you could literally say that about every spiderman game just swap out the graphics due to the year it comes out,0
,0
seeing this makes me wanna buy a ps then i remembered i m not a sellout and xbox still has a more powerful console nice try though insomniac and sony,0
honestly this game seems a bit overrated,0
not call of duty ign,0
mario odyssey makes you really feel like mario,0
his mentor is doc oc,0
ohhh yeah on their first spidey game it s enough for me haven t played it yet and i can t wait for spidey on ps,1
there it is,0
cmonnnnn ik most of our own reviews will at least be a,0
damn qtes,0
should have gave a higher score,0
puddles,1
looks like ign didn t got the desired amount from sony hence the low rating,1
so much spoilers,0
no spideymobile,0
couldnt look or feel more spiderman,0
typical ign,0
rather have lego spider man,0
i wish i didn t watch this i feel like i ve seen a lot,0
hours lmao dlcs are longer than that preorder canceled,0
goty they said,0
this game better have the raimi suit,0
if you compare this to sunset overdrive an xbox exclusive made by insomniac games they re kinda similar,0
smaller puddles,0
this or horizon zero dawn,0
but can you deliver pizzas,0
i just wanna gear the review nothing about the gameplay cuz i live in the us and we got like more days until release,0
what s the review score on xbox one x the most powerful console ever true k fps with xbox game pass and crossplay to nintendo switch i m just curious you know o,0
when are you peter parker what do you do i only saw cutscenes,0
too much webs,0
venom dlc,0
makes you feel spider man ign sounds familiar to me,0
also three new dlc that will come out in to can t wait still waiting still yeee,0
look at how shadows on the building are loading only when u r near them k but cant even render shadow lol,0
give call of duty ghosts and give spiderman ps wow ign you guys make total sense,1
that s bullshit when cod comes out it will be a buuuuullllllllllshhhhhiiiiiiitttttttttt,0
with great power comes a ps stay thirsty my x box friends,1
literally anything that isn t cod is doomed to get less than,0
they said it was hours with only main missions over hours with all content,0
so let me get this straight this game makes you feel like spider man,0
this game reminds me so much of the spiderman game i had for xbox i think the map was very similar with the yellow pings around the city,0
too much spider not enough man,0
is it just the story mode,0
ign is just high key annoying,0
only a hahaha wow what an awful score haha,0
it really makes you feeeeeeeeeel like the hulk,0
the costume looks different than what was shown at e,0
it really makes you feel like spiderman,0
ign too much wed swing,1
why was this game docked i wan t answers ign,0
it puzzles me how so much ign hate is always in the comments but people always feel the need to watch every video and comment on top of that the reviews are subjective on top of that bro ignore the score listen to and actually go read the full review if you don t agree then cool yall got so much internet hate in your hearts lol,1
why does mj sound like ellie from the last of us,0
nice see their doing emotional stuff like in tobby movies had,0
venom dlc maybe,0
did they get peter parker to do the review or something this guy sounds like he s fourteen,0
wtf they just give it a random number,0
just watch blops gets a,0
already the best best superhero game to date,0
uhm is this ps only,0
makes you feel like you heard this before,0
the first sentence of the review really makes you feel like spider man,0
not gonna lie you re the best at web swinging out of everyone i ve seen so far,0
is this someone else s review as well,0
better luck next gen xbox,0
too many buildings,0
didn t spiderman movie game got a as well,0
starting the review with qtes makes this review sound like a setup,0
really makes you feel like batman,1
wtf delete ign,0
hour adventure,0
dammit ign you gave call of duty advanced warfare a and this masterpiece an what the hell,0
never understood how you can rate something that just came out give it time to at least age,0
in the title of this video should have said spoiler review,0
i thought i killed spiderman,0
mr stark i don t feel like spider man,1
i like how the reviews always complain that the side mission or challenges are repetitive in open world games i could get into a different way of doing it but what do you expect i love the review because they are right so my question is how do you make challenge events seem like they are not in a open world game,0
ign i can not believe it how could you give this marvelous game a score rating this is outrageous this game deserves a perfect score rating i could settle for a whatever i m going to watch the review from gamespot at least i know they will give the game the score rating it deserves you know your monologue was an it was great but not amazing,1
how i review the game not out,0
probably getting a ps just for this,0
i m just here to see how much ign is going to blow this game out of proportion,0
can u play the old spider man theme song while swinging around the city,0
marvel s spiderman ps review great,0
it makes me way too happy that theres a damaged suit in the game,0
seems like a low score considering how much he seemed to love it and had a spectacular time,1
too much man in spider man ign,0
to much swinging,0
the games not even out yet,0
not enough spiders,0
playing ps makes me feel like a gamer,1
pc is still better,0
wtf are you insane,0
the qtes look very lame tho,0
so many comments saying we don t trust ign review but still they are watching this video,1
glad my local game shop doesn t wait for official launch dates i have the disc in the ps right now and it s copying application gb to be exact and wants to download v update of something gb,0
uncle ben remember with great power comes great responsibility peter parker spider man whatever life holds in store for me i will never forget these words with great power comes great responsibility this is my gift my curse,0
jmdornbush attorney at law,0
so you beat it in hours but also spend hours on web slinging i am confused,0
so basically its a thanks ign,0
too bad i don t have a ps damnnnn,0
i love how the reviewer sounds like a basic spiderman character,0
made me feel like bugs bunny,1
wher is game of the year fans,0
i just gotta say seeing all the suits makes me even more hyped for the game,0
nice review jonathan i d rather know about short comings of a game than gush like a fanboy especially when i haven t played the game yet besides means the game will be great,0
you choose spiddaa maaan,0
ps store won t sell it to me,0
so it s out now,0
but is it better than spider man the movie game on ps,0
too much spider not enough man,0
at it s core insomnia games s adventure strives to make you feel like spider man,0
just realised how boring ign is unfollow in progress,0
you give to the best superhero game ever made wtf ign,0
my xbox one x is ready d oh,0
let me see if i can feel like spiderman on my xbox,0
ign too many costumes,0
makes you feel like batman,1
is an open world that big even worth it it seems like they just created it for show you can t really do much other than high five pedestrians and find your backpacks there are no cars no other playable superheroes and no reason to keep the game after ypu completed it the open world isn t really fun as you will get bored of jusf swinging around repeatedly they should ve added the spider verse characters and defenders,0
cant wait to swing through new york city on friday,0
you hear that dunkey you were right,0
who is he looking at lol,0
so this what y all playstation fans hype about huh,0
i m happy that this game is getting a lot of praise i plan to get it this friday so i m excited to finally play this,0
no respect for resistance,0
was this review plagerised,0
check out mr sunday movies review of this game,0
why is this not on xbox one it should also be available on xbox just like batman arkham,0
says the game is hours long also says that he spent hours just swigging around so they mean that the game is less that hours long why do other reviewers says it s between to h are you guys speed running it or,0
this game makes you feel like spiderman,1
bruh,0
but we can all agree that spiderman on ps is the best spiderman game of all time,0
i wonder what the villain at the end the prison break demo was,0
did jonah hill review this game,0
omg you should be fired boring as review,0
is a fine score but they did give arkham knight a higher score which was disappointing and had some really repetitive batmobile missions,0
the way these journalists and blue check mark people write is exactly how annoying it sounds when it s read this is a trope of the world,0
really lol,0
for a game about a spider there isn t enough spiders ign,0
if you convert their score into a point scale then this game got a people still be mad though,0
game reviewers and spiderman fans will think differently,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
single player is more than alive guys unlike some other company s belief wink wink ea,0
ps or ps pro only,0
should be an,1
what about the puddles though,0
this game makes you feel like batman,0
most likey gonna pick this up and make some let s play on it so,0
i don t think ign ratings become accurate this year like they gave detroit become human and other reviews were like,0
wanted a at least but still great score,0
homecoming suit daaamnnn,0
too much web swinging,0
all the downgrade critics eat your hearts out,0
but are there enough puddles,0
what ea mean when they say single player games are dead is they find it hard to milk money out of us when it comes to single player games,1
please make a ben,0
pizza time,1
insomniac really makes you feel like spider man,0
fu k ign this game is epic,0
did philip miucin write this review,0
looks like every other spider man game,0
ummm not bad actually,0
very unfortunate that this game won t be on pc,0
i didn t forget about the downgrade of the puddles ign,0
yuri lowenthal spiderman sasuke,0
best game ooof,0
beautiful game,0
is this reviewed by filip miucin,0
where is the downgrade microsoft dickheads,1
this deserve a sorry ign,0
we need resistance fall of man remastered,0
i heard it was only hours of gameplay though disappointed,0
i knew this game was gonna be the best spidey game,0
great review,1
yup totally downgraded looks to beautiful,0
and this is why batman is the best,0
can t wait to fight big wheel,0
cool i m glad i pre ordered spider man game can t wait in a few days to play it with a pre order bundle pack,1
is spider man game in native k,0
shadow of the tomb raider next,0
to much webs,0
puddles not realistic,0
ign don t know what they talking about this game deserves a at least smh this is one of the best spider man game ever plus if u notice that black kid is going to be the new spider man in that up coming movie,0
fortnite is better,0
the words of ign are worth nothing,0
wtf happened so many great words and not even a,0
says nothing but positive things for of the review gives it an,0
awesome,0
according to ign fortnite is better than spiderman,0
whats the difference between an and an lol what does the amount from lol,0
not enough puddles,0
yes it s this friday so cannot wait to play i love spider man so mush my all time favorite superhero i hope peter and mary jane will work things out and get back together i really love that cutscene with them man this is going to be a great game,0
i prefer superman games basically ign,1
not black ops,0
why does peter looks like andrew garfield,0
i am not getting dlcs though,0
no thug bowling though,0
finally the spider man game i ve been waiting for,0
spoilers much seems like this review told a little too much of the story in my opinion still can t wait to play it,0
this is no fortnite im outta here,0
cod b feels like is missing something ign,0
for real ign please,0
i bet you that black ops gets a better score but a proper game like this one gets the pacing issues and repetitive moments speech pshh its an open world game its bound to have a few repetitive moments if you are more bent on loking for them then playing the game and those things are enough to lower the score by just lol,0
not enough pizza time,0
assassin s creed really made me feel like ezio,0
i didn t expect this game to get this score but has ign ever gave a game a on anything,0
rushed review,0
why are people so triggered over points,0
quick time events,0
not enough spiders,0
bruh there s nothing on xbox,0
no hot scenes,1
can never please everyone,0
i just wanted to know if this was gonna be as fun as the amazing spider game back in and it seems i was correct on that,0
i can t get over that yuri plays sasuke and always seems cold and serious but sounds happy and really uplifting as spiderman,0
i love dornbush,0
once again ign is a useless channel,0
it really makes you feel like spiderman,0
dude this guys delusional hes not spiderman,0
wow thanks for telling us if the downgrade is real or not,0
it s out are there any playthrough s,0
reviewed on xbox,0
how am i sure that this is an honest ign review and not a lower known youtube s,0
the isn t a bad score but the guy was talking up as if it were a so it was unexpected,1
i m an xbox one owner is this game worth buying a ps for i loved the batman games and wanted a similar experience with this one,1
it makes you feel like batman,0
just proves that playstation doesnt make better exclusives madden got a better ratingg than this crap just a cashgrab batman arkham knight clone trying to bring spiderman in a serious approach isnt the way to go,0
ign is trash,0
quick time events well i guess there s still rdr,0
hours i oh man,0
,1
ok everyone needs to chill about before this comment gets even more toxic is a great score and people are arguing that madden got a better score well guess what that was a different person can t we just enjoy a game,0
not enough puddles,0
scores don t matter for this game you ll enjoy it regardless also there s no way this game is better than gow so that s a great score folks at insomniac must be happy i ll get it after a rebate though,0
the spider man music is raimi movie inspired not by the avengers,0
yeah right you are the same guys who gave to msg v while to witcher,0
pls add cjwest on instagram pls,1
this game makes you f e e l like batman,0
atleast it dosnt have too mutch spider man,0

sequel confirmed maximum carnage,1
i thought the game came out the th,0
meanwhile xbox fans enjoying forknight on most powerful console on the market,0
an outstanding review jonathon thank you,0
hour adventure,0
i haven t played the game yet but praising the game the entire video with just one flaw should at least have made it into the the mid section,0
not really digging this guy s review logic,0
how many times did he say repetitive omg just play fortnite and leave single player masterpieces alone,0
did peter parker review this wtf,0
is it just me or this video sounds like being reviewed by peter parker himself lol,1
this game really makes you feel like spider man ign,0
this review talks way too general gamespot did the justice put more effort in spiderman review with times more detail than this,0
hours lol,0
guess who s not gonna be studying when this comes out,0
review before the game is out life is unfair i need it now,0
ign sunset overdrive spiderman,0
wish it was for xbox too,0
what happened to review embargo,0
this game is atleast a,0
already pre ordered can t wait to play,0
they need to bring it to xbox,0
it makes you feel like batman,0
reviews that s not the review i wanted,0
i think ign gave it an just make it look like a scientifically analyzed score,0
awesome game,0
isn t bad but i honestly think it s damn near a not everything needs multiplayer,0
i m even more excited now,0
reminds me a lot of infamous which makes me very happy,0
could you imagine this not being just a spider man game but a marvel game in general where you could play with many different types of characters from the marvel universe as well as go online and have v fights all the way up to v fights as well as multiplayer free roam an ultimate marvel game is what marvel needs that s would arguably be one of the greatest games ever,0
i m waiting for the dunkview this review ain t nothing but bogus,0
david so out here making move got himself in a game,0
need a venom dlc,0
more days yeah,0
ign not enough spiderdick,0
charly bit me oh wait,0
i give it what bs rating method is this give or,0
i can always count on ign for an in depth review,0
not enough puddles,1
insomniac games at its core strives to make you feel like spider man instant dunkey flashbacks,1
really this game deserves more it has to be around whats wrong with ign they ll give a freaking indie game but amazing game like this an i dont really trust ign in reviews m afraid they ll give red dead redemption an even though it deserves more,0
enjoy your millions of control pads xbox i ll be playing this with my one and only pad,0
with great power comes great responsibility somebody should tell filip miucin that line,0
ign rating too much spider man,0
can swinging with first person view be done,0
what the heck is an ffs just give it a,0
spider non binary gender,0
batman arkham asylum set the bar because of that we ve had superhero games finally step up,0
im crying days left lets goo,0
i can imagine what a means i can imagine what a means but what the hell is a,0
it s a masterpiece for me,0
thanks for this no spoilers video,0
let s just take time to realise that ign gave cod ghost a higher score i don t trust a word these guys say,1
is it just me that finds it weird that metacritic currently as a score from critics and ign decides to give the game also a score,0
too many puddles,0
got the spiderman game advert before this spiderman game video,0
i cannot wait to play this game,0
if they made a new ratchet and clank i personally woulda have been happier since i ve never been a spider man fan don t really want to play this most likely wont i just want to play my child hood in next gen game plz,0
nice,0
an hmmmm i expected at least a high,0
too much web swinging,0
but what about the puddles,0
why are you reviewing ps version im on pc is it any better,0
hey hey spoilers dont show me the suits,0
not call of duty ign,0
cool now everyone can stop calling it game of the year red dead redemption is going to get s all across the board,0
these comments make dunkey feel like a memelord,0
love how everyone shits on arkham knight but it got a better score than this game,1
dissapointing lack of natural animation flow quick times are excessively slow and easy oversaturated and bright the games design and aesthetics are forced how long will this stay exclusive what if i told you i had spiderman on xbox i d rather wait for them to give in and allow backwards compatability for xbox one or just play any other game i already own,0
i thought ign was going to give it a,0
naw man should be,0
silky smooth at fps fps needs to be games consoles new standard seriously fps is useful in competitive shooters because we can see this many frames when adrenaline kicks in for the average gamer frames is the sweet spot it really is silky smooth and responsive as fast as no but smooth and fast enough for the average game and fps is fine when watching a movie but when it comes to gaming you will more than likely need those extra frames when it comes to a hard boss or to react to something in time don t even suggest it s absolutely pointless i notice a huge difference between and i notice a small difference between and but between and the cost just isn t worth the time to even consider as for this spidey game i am pumped for it but may not get it straight away i laugh at these morons that think it s going to be the best superhero game or just best game ever made it s not it s gonna have some drawbacks i m excited because it s a new superhero game and i want more though i want to see more than just batman and spider man,1
made me feel like spiderman,0
again i say kingpin looks like he s from the saints,0
reeeent,0
at least it s better than what ea s crap is coming out this year,0
i m sorry did you say avengers tower is in this,0
so glad my two favorite superheroes each get amazing games made for them,0
i don t care what s coming off his gums this is the best spider man game ever,0
doesn t feel like batman,1
ign you guys need to learn rounding up review of games deserved,0
that looks like a lot of puddles to me,0
not enough puddles,0
please do a review on puddles,0
man this game will actually make me feel like batman,0
we need spiderman web of shadows,0
i would have just rounded it to but you know typical ign,0
i know it came out today but i m getting it on black friday so i can shop for more games this year,0
well parker is spiderman,0
oh man this is a let down why why not at least a,0
claps,0
still can t believe they d make a game on such a universally loved character exclusive to one platform i have a ps but i hate exclusivity it s so corporate,0
ign villians are to hard so it can t be a ign makes me sick,0
ehh but does it make you feel like batman,0

i wonder who miles is talking to at,1
why the hell did you mention taskmaster no one knew that he was in the game thx for the spoiler smh,0
ign to much webs,1
but those downgraded graphics tho,0
this will be the best game ever,0
peter friendzoned mj woah,1
modern reviews have absolutely destroyed the rating system the fact that anything below a is considered bad is hilarious,0
harmless quick time events repetitive boss battles odd pacing ign,0
,0
really makes you feel like spider man amirite,0
lets see how many of us actually finish the game lol i know im gonna waste most of my time just swinging thru the city lol,0
can you guys review naruto to boruto shinobi strikers,0

this game really makes you feel like spiderman where have i heard that before,0
jim sterling gave his thoughts now waiting for zp to give the final verdict,0
making you guys happy is impossible,0
ofc tomb raider will be game of the year,0
this review seems all over the place and there s something oddly fake sounding about the review narration but regardless the game still looks fantastic i was going to pre order until i learned that insomniac decided to withhold content for dlc coming out in a few weeks it s a shame that this shady business practice has made its way into a company that i ve been fond of for years now i think i ll just wait for the inevitable holiday sale s,0
hrs i thought it was,0
deserves at least a imo,0
too much buildings,0
so excited for this when i am back from me holiday,0
i dont ses how u guys are sayin the batman series is still better when most of u guys haven t even played the game yet n on top of that this is just the st one,0
save my money for rdr,0
wait for sale,0
tmnt deserve a game like this with your classic design,0
i would like to see some other marvel characters added with story content it s a big open world all the unaccessible building could be made accessible and integrated with storys in a update but it s call spider man not marvel world,0
gonna buy this when it drops to dollars,0
mj is so cute goshh,0
this game isn t finished too short and just when it gets going it s over,0
i wish it was on xbox as well,0
really makes you feel like spider man,0
first person mode please,0
i could be wrong but the fact that he said it surprised him with its hour adventure makes me think he bombed through it on the easiest difficulty without absorbing some of the extra content outside the story which would probably fill in a lot of the holes he claims the game has the only flaw i can t argue against yet is that the story has pacing issues either way an for a rushed gameplay review isn t bad,0
thanks for a shallow review of a great game gamespot reviewed it so much better than you guys it deserve no less than a,0
this is all well and great but is there an arkham batman suit,0
can we stop with the puddlegate bullshit now,0
i am going to play this game sorry school i ll take a few days off,0
metacritic gave it a,0
is too much for this game,1
wtf if the game is as u say great why did u give it it s easily,0
masterpiece make you feel like a batman,0
i can t wait to get this spider man vibes,0
who complains about an especially for a spider man man game a literally makes this the greatest spider man game of all time,0
is it bad i really want to skip my cousins wedding this weekend to play this game,0
this is a fantastic review,0
almost the same as the game on gamecube,0
all the dislikes are xbox users,0
too short not worth,0
or whatever for me its a on,0
spider man ps makes you really feel like batman,0
how many hours wow that s short,0
got an ad for shadow of the tomb raider they ruined that series,0
okay okay but is there a side quest where a little girl screams my balloon because that was the best side quest on spider man ps,0
deserves,0
i came for the score too,0
insomniac now make the hulk game hulk smash that city haha,0
can you enter each and every building in the game,0
lmao i hate this channel,0
even batman arkham city has more ratings than this wtf this is absolutely unfair rating it should be masterpiece means man this is not fair,0
spoiler peter parker is spider man,0
anyone else low key jealous because we cant play on xbox,0
not enough puddles,1
not enough puddles ign,0
the reason why anyone is upset about the score is because ign would give a game with a lot less s or even a,0
whatever the review is i don t care m gonna buy this game,0
wish this wasn t an exclusive,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
no doubt better than batman games,0
knowing ign they gona give blackops a higher score,0
is it the th yet,0
well whatdaya expect its ign,0
ugh ps becomes more and more tempting,0

well this is a official must buy game solid score,0
too much spider not enough man,1

game is a ign,0
hrs yup sliced up dlc,0
should ve been at least a with the way he was praising it,0
not enough puddles,0
the way jonathon spoke about the game during the entire review had me expecting a or above i find it confusing that he spoke so highly of it even with minor pacing issues to only give it an o,0
why is everyone tripping over an that s a great score,0
no spiders,0
hour,0
not enough puddles,1
not enough puddles,1
hours of single player in a game where single player is the only option you run out of things to do a bit like dying light or basically any other single player open world game won t be buying this i played spiderman it was okay but leaves a bad taste in your mouth this feels like the same exact game really,0
who is the raft villian unknown,0
sadly i m on xbox but the game looks absolutely brilliant,0
this dude really sounds like frozen s olaf,0
nice video,0
th score doesnt fit the review,0
it sounded like a and the deicmal is weird but its fine,0
damn a b,1
spider soy,0
give it a week and the hype will be gone,0
doesn t feel enough like a batman game,1
doesn t take place in arkham,0
makes you feel like spiderman,0
when you re too bad at the game to admit it s a masterpiece,0
for any requests mail to peter parker de xd,0
not enough pizza time,1
dunkview is the only review i trust,0
fortnite scored more then this let that sink in,1
idk if batman got a better score this looks so beautiful and masterpiece way better than batman,0
almost every other review gave it a or,0
the guys from easy allies gave it a,0
too much web swinging,0
i got turned off by making you feel like spiderman such an expected and uncreative statement to use in a review but hey what more can i expect from ign,0
ign too much puddles,0
they took a great step forward idc this game is dope,0
makes you spider like feel man,0
i can t wait for this spider man game i take it that battle with kingpin will be the prologue level about when spider man finally takes him down then he s arrested tight also this is everything spider man is really supposed to be unlike how it is in the mcu now i mean all that about homecoming just didn t seem like a real spider man thing to me he seems like a weak amateur where were the usual spider man characters like redhead mj watson harry osborn gwen stacy big tall bully flash thompson the older aunt may,0
x box fans r missing big hit game,0
i think this game deserves more than,0
if y all gonna praise a game like this at least give it a,0
i was seriously surprised this isn t a but whatevs,0
too much web,0
f g hell not even a wow thats cold ign i kinda dont want the game now,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
makes you feel like spiderman lol,0
this game is out,0
awesome review wish i had a ps to enjoy the fun,0
this game would be so much better if they added a little more puddles,0
epic,0
please tell me how u can review just now and its not even out the th of september wow man the say this game even get better rating thn madden madden jst the same as but with better graphics with just a weaker story mode in longshot thn the first i am a massive madden fan but c mon ign it must b a better rating,0
u xbox fans boys mad,1
pretty sure he gave it a couple points down just to appear critical the way he described the game sounded like a,1
does it make you feel like batman cause that s all that matters,0
might as well give it a,1
they picked the guy who sounds like peter parker to do the review lol,1
makes you feel like spider man,0
i swear i got a spider man ad,0
can we all agree we get this for xbxo,0
who is still waiting for arthur morgan,0
did he just say hour adventure or,0
i m going to be really depressed when i beat this game and have done everything there is to do after a week or so of owning the game guess i ll check out the suits,0
this game looks gorgeous too bad its too expensive for me to play now will wait for a sale or something,0
people were expecting higher ratings because it was so hyped the criticisms seem pretty valid to me pattern based boss fights are a big letdown,0
most reviewers gave it a i should of known ign will give it a low score,0
the game released,0
this game really makes you feel like spider man,0
just say low,1
i don t trust ign that much but it was the first review and wanted to know,0
i couldn t even finish this review just such a boring buzz word filled review and it makes you feel like spiderman cmon,0
hour adventure lol another redbox rental game,0
i guess i am the only one that thinks this game looks mediocre,0
minute best suit for me and after that stark suit this means that stark will probably be in the game,0
come ign just give it,0
i kind of taught myself not to take ign s reviews seriously anymore,0
wow so hyped to buy this game only to beat it the first night i get it and stop ultimately playing after weeks,0
since insomniac did so well with the spider man i feel it s time we get a well deserved iron man game and they ve got everything to pull it off or even better an avengers game that would be something else lol,0
can you chanhe the metro redux review,0
fortnite got a so is fortnite better than spider man skyrim and witcher pls answer ign,0
ign needs to stop giving ratings in point and use whole numbers instead,0
woah with the way they hyped this game up until the release as well as how this review went i did not expect that,0
they showed so much gameplay that they can already make an review even tho it s not even out yet,0
too much puddles,0
thank you insomniac games thank you so much one day i will get the limited edition ps bundle,0
this review as the others i saw dont feel true they totaly feel scripted my score for the game is maybe i will probably buy it on extreme sale just to see the story,1
they was just saying the other day the game was hr long as soon as the video started on my hr adventure hold up hold up whatt,0
i m gonna pretend like i didn t hear anything about task master or mjs relationship,0
is just backwards i see what you did there,0
still can t wait and is alright though it deserves a,0
so basically batman at day,0
gow is an overhyped shitty game but never did ign mention the repetitive troll bosses and puzzles and gave it but repetition is mentioned on this review all about the money,0
it deserves a,0
why is ign soooo bad at reviews lol,0
these comments,0
they really said feel like spider man twice xd,0
mary jane watson is a supermodel not some red haired six,0
makes you feel like spider man that what happens if they not copying reviews,0
so why not release it in pc please please,0
what i thought it would be a,0
the best thing about ign review videos is the comment section,0
who cares about what these guys think i d give it my own rating once i play it,0
i can t wait,0
aw man it makes you feel like spiderman i wanted to feel like aquaman guess this is a pass for me,0
and ign was mind,1
makes you feel like a spiderman,0
wish uncle ben was here to see this,0
too much power too less responsibility,1
hour campaign are you freaking serious yeah thats worth buying a ps for,1
compared to other aaa games it s kinda low,0
rachet and clank was never wack lol,0
it s almost like the bosses and combat were developed separately to have all these cool moves and gadjets and then just stun then hit the boss seems like such a waste,1
even i cant waity to play it yet i still think i wait for ps for this xd,0
did they give a to avoid giving the same score as any other reviewer,0
i almost forgot that sasuke plays spiderman in this game,0
too many webs,0
the game really makes you feel like batman,0
this game deserves more,0
reduced graphics,0
woah i didn t know there was gonna be spoilers lmfaooo my heart dropped when i heard task master,0
is this the punisher in this spiderman game,0
dat day dlc tho,0
game starts i don t feel s o g o o d,0
too much spider,0
not enough filip muicin,0
haha arkham knight beats spiderman ps,0
hours so you played on easy i see,0
let s stop watching reviews and give the game our own opinion please,0
ign and pacing issues name a more iconic duo,1
too much web ign,1
this was the game that was going to put the final blow to the xbox this year but the down grade has put this to a halt i was going to buy a ps pro for this game i will save my money and wait for some ps or next box in,0
too much buildings in manhattan,0
dude how did u review the game so fast this is a rushed reviewm,0
meh still prefer batman games,0
ok so it makes you feel like spider man but can it make you feel like elon musk,1
this game is over hyped,0
gaming community in a nut shell a game they are excited for gets anything but a or and all hell breaks loose,0
by ign by everyone else,1
finally a great spiderman game,0
shouldve been a,0
i was expecting a negative be not enough puddles,0
why is everyone mad about the opinion is subjective m if your watching this to validate your opinion then why are you even watching a review,1
this game looks crap,0
you had me at laura bailey,0
why not just round it to,0
can t wait until friday and great review,0
anybody comparing this game to batman arkham series needs to see how differently these two games are i recommend they watch the video by miles j escapade puts those thoughts to rest,1
ign cant trust you anymore waiting for other reviews,0
this needs to be on the xbox one no doubt,0
for the best superhero game ever created,0
meats back on the menu boys,0
whole boat pops in view no lod nothing,0
thank you ign,0
haven t watched it yet but i m betting i hear one of two things it s the dark souls of spider man games or it makes you feel like spider man,0
i wonder where the was lost,0
i m so glad i pre ordered this,0
it should be,0
i noticed a trend the games that ign overhype alot tend to be rated alot lower than you think lol,0
danm why can be or,0
spiderman ps makes you feel like spiderman ign and thats how you see a man s career die,0
hahaha i just saw the other comments and i agree at least just for the look of the game nobody played it yet wait a little,0
whoever reviewed this you don t deserve to to play video games,1
bs skip the whole video ugh,0
don t let this distract you from the fact that ea thinks single player is dead folks,1
i just love spidey s suit in this game,0
hah not the perfect masterpiece people expected a spidey game will always be a bad spidey game,0
only so many of us are gonna catch that reference,1
ign s scores are like the points in whose line they don t matter,0
this is just another batman game ugh,0
i ll just wait for dunkeys review,0
i can t stand those reviewers voices anymore why they all feel the need to emphasize adjectives like that can t they just say a word without overstretching it it s so annoying to hear things like exxxxciiiiiiitiiiiiing can t you just pronounce exciting,0
this video makes me feel like dunkey,0
marvel s spider man really makes you feel like marvel s spider man,0
hours,0
combat looks more devil may cry than arkham,1
spiderman spiderman,1
woh hours i clearly remember hearing not too long ago from another source that the campaign alone is hours,0
he looks nothin like peter parker but ttt its the best gamer evv sike fallout looks better,0
hey i m just here for the comments and to check on what is the next bickering subject as you were,0
this is one of the dumbest review ever he spent most of his time webbing around the boss battle felt repetitive the suits were there but he just used the ones he started with because you know op he occasionally changed things up in battles because there was no need to playing spiderman felt like spiderman but actually being peter was more fun because this is the only way he could talk to girs the game gets in the end because swing simulator in ny is fun wow great review,0
dunkey s video is fking biblical lmao,1
bruh i would give,1
coolarrrrrrrrrkkkkkkkk means goooooooooo spider man,1
anyone catch that dashboard confessional reference,0
is this one of the rare times ign s score is less than gamespot s gs score,0
make tyiou feel likern spiofederman,0
why do you need the game to encourage you to do new things seriously the point of the game is to have your own fun so have your own fun don t wait for the game to tell you things your just missing out,1
imagine how this will look on the xbox one x,0
i expected more than but it s still a great game i wish i could play this on pc spiderman was my favourite cartoon character when i was child those were the days when i needed to feel like spiderman but anyway i m now and i still wanna become spiderman,0
out of not call of duty,0
ign metacritic whoa they nailed it,1
this video already has more dislikes than gamespots review lul,0
anybody else upset he dropped an easter egg spoiler like the avenger tower lol would have been cool to see that while swinging through the city,0
this has the same rating as spider man homecoming the irony,0
too many spider webs,0
only hours feelsbadman in the chat,1
should ve just given it an honestly wtf,0
after long search for best spider man game i finaly found it sry spidey from ps i found my no,0
how do you have months of coverage and then rate the developers game under a kind of insulting and your voice does not help,0
too bad its on a shitty console,0
gtfoh,0
for those of you that thumbs down why click on to the review,0
makes you really feel like you re batman,0
wait it s only hours,0
i ll wait for filip miucin s review that s the only one i trust,1
glad i got divinity instead,0
and now spider man is trash,0
i only like batman,0
cod will get from ign,0
only,0
not a nintendo exclusive,0
feeel like spider man,0
too many webs,0
it should be at least,1
wait the backpacks have been there since his high school days so spidey s webs aren t biodegradable what about all the other webs he s littered all over the city spider man is a menace not enough environmental protection,0
not gonna lie even i m not side with insomniac this game still amazing is reasonable ps why bother watch review if you re already set score in your mind,0
spider man on ps makes you feel like spider man,0
hey guys what i really love about this game is that it makes you feel like spider man,0
too much buildings,0
mary jane looks cute in this game,0
wtf this gamespot lol,0
hours not worth i check this out on a steep holiday discount,0
damn i wish he hadn t mentioned the names of the voice actors for the main characters since i m familiar with both of them now i won t be able to see anything but their face when the characters talk does anyone else have this issue when they know the voice actors for a character,0
i want to be the puddles tho,0
the next ps exclusive hit,0
the arkham games day to be the batman but this game it s be the spider man this game is sooooo on my christmas list,0
looks about the same as the last two the amazing spider man entries,0
does this game have an end game,0
the hell why not a,0
just add more puzzles looooool head,0
pacing issues,0
i know i may never will but i needs to come to pc,0
first question this is your review right lol,1
i think gamers are becoming more and more idiotic,0
serious its not igns fault i am sure if they had kept puddles it would have been game of the year,0
for me,0
bruhhh cant wait for the avengers game for ps lmao i hope it will come true,1
if it was i might have bought it,0
i think spiderman should deserve more than,1
too many buildings,0
spider man makes feel like spider man so but cod same crap every year,0
oh that,0
aaaand xbox just took another l one day,0
makes you feel like spider man never change ign or do and get some goddamn integrity either way,0
halve this stuff makes zero sense the game didn t encourage me to use the other suits i was waiting for the fighting systems depth,0
i had a hard choice choosing spiderman special edition or shadow of the tomb raider croft edition went for the latter just really hyped for it and want to know the conclusion to laras reboot story cant wait to play of the th and then this hell yeahhh wohooo,0
this dude had no complaints but gave it a huh,0
batman dies in the end,0
is this the cobblepot actor from gotham speaking,0
i thought they would say focuses to much on this swinging lol,0

why its not masterpiece only great,0
too bad theres no pizza delivery,0
why is everybody be getting pissy about an is an almost perfect game none of y all have even played it yet,0
too much spider man feels ign,0
this video makes me feel like clicking out of it,0
you are not plagiarizing if you actually give a score of you do know that right ign,0
so what made the minus,0
i m not so sure that s reflective of the whole review,0
needs more puddles tho,0
a from gamespot but an on ign must be opposite day,0
ign doesn t even know how to review games geez they don t even have anyone that knows how to play games,1
i can t wait to every single thing in this game the hype is real,0
wooooow,0
ign too much spider not enough man,0
can you believe that today a hour game costs and no one finds it strange,1

my opinion is,1
not enough rains drops,0
the mj sections feel like they ll diminish the replay value of the game,0
ign s reviews keep getting shittier and incoherent,0
now your going to give cod bo a for being new and original,0
playing spiderman makes tou feel like spiderman sounds plagerised,0
this makes me feel like storm from x men flying to the sky hehehe,0
is a great score people what is wrong with you,1
if you don t get to play as miles morales at some point i will be slightly disappointed,0
the soundtrack o o o,0
too many spiders not enough men ign,0
playing marvel s spider man on ps pro really makes you feel like john cena,0
gamespot s review was so much better and in detail you guys left a lot out,0
not enough spider man,0
ign is the worst and always been the worst for reviews lmao gamespot is better,0
too much spider man,0
dunkey he said it makes you feel like spider man,0
finally great spider man game that s deserve to be a spiderman,0
better than arkham knight,0
no puddles,0
mary jane s model looks waaaay off,0
you say cod is not repetitive,0
calling it this game gets ported to pc xbox one in months tops,0
this game deserve better,0
metacritic turns out it s a disappointment considering the other ps exclusives released well can t wait to buy it next year for bucks with all the dlc,1
everyone s all butt hurt about a as if that s bad bunch of morons,1
to many spiders,0
i m glad a game like this exists sony did the right thing spiderman and superman are my favorite sueprheores,0
too many bugs,0
definitely a must buy if you like open world single player games,0
that s fals it s,0
not enough shirtless spiderman,0
lots of sony checks today i see,0
the movement is basically prototype movement with occasional web swing i wouldn t call that a fluid movement especially for a spiderman,0
so dead cell is better,0
just at the beginning of the video but minute adventure made me jump back in my seat,0
,0
keep in mind that anything over is above average,0
didn t make me feel like spider man enough,1
just give it a damn sheesh round up,0
i m playing it right nowwwww,0
i wasn t expecting the game to be a so hearing that it s a b actually falls in line with my prediction i know that no matter what the score i m still going to enjoy swinging around nyc as spider man as a matter of fact my most favorite thing to do in spider man on the gamecube was climbing and then jumping off the empire state building jonathan mentioning that in his review just made my anticipation for this game even greater than it already was,1
yeah but dragon quest xi,0
the score doesn t quite seem to match up with the praise that this review lavished on the game the only bad thing they had to say was that the open world wasn t all that great but from what i ve seen of this game i ve not perceived this an open world game it s an adventure game right i think that s what the makers where going for right with that in mind the score seems harsh,0
it doesn t make you feel like superman,0
fuk this game imma stick with minecraft k,0
hrs i hope you mean,1
too much feels,1
hrs i hope you mean,0
more puddles and ign would ve gave it a,0
at the end of the day can t always rely on ign to properly give a just rating,0
so why not a lol,0
i was expecting or above,0
it deserves atleast a,0
hype off wish i didn t watch this,0
i wish they d stop showing never before seen f footage a little bit before the game comes out like i ve been seen too much and that was last week smh,0
i don t own a ps but games like this tempt me to no end nice job sony insomniac for making spider man feels like a comic come to life,0
it has to be out of,0
they brought the puddle back,0
why isn t the freedom tower in the game,0
ahhhhhh,0
spider man is my favorite superhero no lie it s an iconic superhero tom holland playing him well so far and his villians,0
not enough batman,1
i never understood this idea of calling gameplay repetitive you can t just call core gameplay repetitive cuz by that logic literally every first person shooter is a repetitive waste of time since there s pretty much one thing you do you shoot shoot and shoot,0
yes we have dronie and that s all i want,1
hmmm i feel like the reviewer was giving of vibes not i say that cuz he makes it seem like it s lacking something,0
great no puddle,0
hours sheesh,0
i quit watching after the first minute ign clearly has no idea what they re talking about,0
few harmless quick times feel like spider man,0
game deserves a or at least a its brilliant,0
waiting for angry joe review,1
ign y all are full of it could have gave it a smh never liked you guys anyway,0
spider man ps not enough puddles ign,0

rags was right ign is full of s amazing game that shouldn t need a review based on the title and developer s zero credits for sony alone definitely don t need ign politics anyone really wanting to see a review should watch either skill up s or yong yea s video,0
so spectacular i splooged at the screen during their romance who else but ign,0
ign reviews make me feel sick,1
expecting a,0
it at least deserves a outa from my point of view,0

to much spiderman but dat though,1
another certified banger for the playstation that we only have a few more days to wait for insomniac pulls no punches the hype factor alone is an easy,0
loved that dashboard confessional reference,0
they should have made a venom game,1
i m a playstation fan who was unlucky enough to get an xbox one welp im definitely getting a ps just for this,0
i m buying this,1
should i buy spider man or horizon zero dawn complete edition,1
not enough pizza delivery missions ign,0
i wanna know what s igns difference between a and an lol,0

i don t want to feel like spider man so i m not buying it,0
q do you feel like spider man a absolutely q do you also feel as broke as peter parker a,0

,0
why are people hating on the score is a great score this is what happens when u give something too much expectation and hype marvel fans wanted to blow away the arkham series really bad,1
i have a ps pro but not a k tv,0
what if there a marvel game that puts you in your own universe you a can choose multiple choices to be a villian hero mercenary etc you can be a spider man woman iron man woman shield agent human fireman woman yes cause everyone is a hero,0

yeah trust the guys who gave dragon quest a,0
nah its to cinematic,0
too much spider man ign,0
searching for the original review atm x,0

i might feel like spider man but does it feel like batman,0
hours for you can get botw for and get over hours,0

terrible review,0
i knew this wouldn t get a or higher yall hyped it up way too much,0
how much percentage is mary jane in this,0
too buggy,0
nobody on ign can review a game not one bit,0
this is probably the lowest score i ve seen for this game every else says its either the best game of the year or the best superhero game ever made super happy to hear that,0
makes you feel like spiderman i damn well hope so,0
f you why is it why not,0
just give it a damn you bastards,0
too much puddles,0

essas notas quebradas da ign s o uma piada ou d ou,0
why do their minds work like is too much but is too little but it is definetly better than sooo it is,1
i ll wait for this to be in the bargain bin seems to repetitive like the batman arkham nights games,0
greatest spider man game but not enough to be goty,0
hours,0
haha why not just say it is a game but i forgot only halo forza and cod gets to a from ign so what did the game has too much web slining was the ai enemys too unpredictible,0
i agree that it should ve been a or above but everyone needs to stop it with the puddles,0
the reviewer did not find a single convincing mistake in the game yet an this is just ign being too nitpicky or is it the puddle gate,0
not compatible with sega dreamcast,0
but do you feel like batman,0
please insomniac give us the puddles as a dlc for,1
why is everyone hating on this reviewer for saying the game makes you feel like spider man isn t that what the point of the game is,0
when is the release date,0
instead of ign why not watch gameranx or even gamespot,0
that s not how you spell batman,0
why is ign so extra like just round it up to a i don t understand how an amazing game gets but an indie game can get,0
it s a great game b but the downgrade,0
what a joke shrea k phive reviewed it way better,0
seems sony gave out a million review codes why not just give the game away for free,0
not enough puddles,0
only on metacritic no more goty contender,0
insomniac games spider man match made in heaven,0
only y tho,0
pumped for this game,0
thought it would be an score,0
to much spiders,0
the ps ver held back the ps pro ver,0

i want to know the full villan list,0
i just want all of you to remember that ign gave uncharted a so ign is mmmmmmmmmmmmmeh,0
not a cod game,0
puddles many too,0
only hours of gameplay yikes,0
the game is brutal deserves more than that it is a game quite complete and innovative at the same time the game that spidey deserved,0
i have a xbox but game has to be above come on ign why so less i know i can t play this game cuz i havr xbox but not expect,0
too much spider not enough man,0
really makes you feel like spiderman,0
this is ludicrous it couldn t even get a score,0
sweet but it s hard to beat spider man,0
when it reveals the big baddie,0
is great still stop being babies,0
how did you guys get peter parker to review this game,0
hey ign can you please request sony to make spiderman ps available for pc,0
do i need to know anything about spiderman before playing this,0
i wish they would stop with the decimals i m just considering it a nine,0
it is time for the mgu marvel s gaming universe,0
the question is it is better than spider man,0
i cant wait for this game im so excited it already looks awesome,0
i was swinging around the city in the ultimate spider man game by activision lol ironically venom was in that game,0
to much web swing,0
hear that is a pcgamer crying,0
it s currently an on metacritic can we stop with the ign jokes and conspiracy theories,1
you know not to trust ign when gamespot ends up giving a for the same game which is rare because gaespot don t give s that often spider man ps makes you feel like spider man my brain straight up went into shut down mode,0
why are people upset about the makes you feel like spider man line,1
seriously,0
no words,0
only hours i ll probably still love it like i loved resident evil but this is an unsettling trend for full price games,0
does anyone else think the reviewer sounds like jonah hill d,0
great now to still wait full days until release,0
i just want the web slingin action who s with me,0
in metacritic rn so it s a must have if you have a ps,1
what bull crapage is this this is at least a,0
it s not call of duty,0
spiderman makes you feeeeeel like spiderman,0
what can i do to add to score,0
kratos is the one who reviewed the game,0
i m not watching it coz i m afraid there might be spoilers,0
spiderman ps call of duty ghosts well done ign,0
hours haha they played it on easy mode,0
tasm still best spooderman game,0
you say great why not spectacular or amazing,0
the open world does not consistently deliver the thrilling moments of the campaign really seems like a problem all open world games have i dont get this score tho praised the game more thn most games tht get or more but it got so weird,0
if you want a better review watch gamespot s,0
can t wait for the dlc oh i forgot it was revealed already,1
why is everyone acting like is a bad score,1
oh just the missing but hey i can t wait anymore,1
why does ign always give such dumbass numbers lmao what does an mean what s the difference from that to a of what too many webs,0
ign please stop reviewing games,0
but they give spiderman a,0
i don t own a playstation but i would have give this game a,0
winding in winding out the shine of which has caught my eye,0
can we say it s a great start of an franchise it s like arkham asylum of spider man game and if there will be a sequel then it ll be like arkham city,0
why not bro,0
do forza horizon please,0
oh yuri lowenthal voices peter in this game bit weird considering he s voicing a younger peter on the disney xd show,0
can this game come out already,0
come on this is a solid,1
couldnt you just round it up to what are you my teacher,1
spider man arkham asylum,1
doc ock final bad guy welcome,0
what an awesome year for ps owners,0
why they didnt make this game for pc,0
the success of this only makes me want a prototype where you can use tendrils in the same manner,0
playing as spider man is not enough,0
i m pretty sure we re all gonna be bullshitting around the city enough to say this is easily a hour game,1
too much spider man,0
ign you re still stuck between and,0
it really makes you feel like batma uh spiderman,0
all xbox users be like outside wow inside lmao sony lol,1
i feel like ign wanted to be the edgy reviewer so gave it a tiny bit less than everyone else lol,0
too much web swinging,1
more spoilers than an honda,0
its ign that means its definitely higher than,0
if only superman could get a game like this for ps apparently it s rocket science for game developers red and blue costume wearing alpha fan favorite superheroes of dc marvel superman and spiderman metropolis new york city,0
not enough puddles,0
too much man not enough spider,0
i want this game on switch please,0
soooooo excited,0
i m too scared of spiders you re welcome,1
why is it a or a evan f gave this a i m waiting for an angry review soon after i play this myself,0
dafuq through the entire review the guy seemed so impressed and yet he scores it an on the other hand the gamespot guy seemed so unimpressed about it and scored it a,0
this makes me even more hyped,0
not enough pizza time,0
kinda disappointed even though it s a great score i kinda was expecting more but i won t judge until i play,1
too much swinging,0
game of the generation,0
do you guys think this game made him feel like spider man,0
makes you feel like spider man where s dunky,0
this game really makes you feel like graphic downgrade,0
lmao,0
looks like it s pizza time,0
sony we got succesful on this game because isomniac games is talented d ea wait did i heard talented we will like to offer sony billion dollars to buy isomniac games to work on super hero games and to beat activison amazing spider man series,1
you know you probably shouldnt choose an anoying sounding voice to narrate videos i just skipped to the end,1
but you guys give call of duty every year yeah definitely an ign review,0
best spidey yet,0
after playing the amazing spiderman on ps recently i already knew what to expect there s not alot of nuances to approaching a super hero game except making an engaging story it s spiderman he s a kid that got bit by a spider and goes around stopping purse snatchers don t look to this for depth and you should be fine,0
it seems if a game is not a or above it s trash,0
let s wait for angry joe to review the game,1
no big wheel,0
finally a spiderman game that cares about the story,0
you could of just gave it a ign loves to give s smh daemon should ve reviewed this,0
this releases on my birthday and i m playing it the second it comes out,0
they could have given it a and i d still be getting the game i ve enjoyed so many games that ign called crap so i don t really listen to them,0
can t wait bro,0
it deserves a at least,1
i expected higher than a,1
hours i have heard from other reviewers that it is hours soo which one is it,0
it better be better than spiderman back in lol,0
great review although i m only taking this at face value until this get s cross checked with boomstick s opinion of the game,0
you know why it has pacing issues because they took out part of the game for dlc,0
me send me some pictures her what do you wanna see babe me spiderman,0
chill the fudge out just because he gave it an doesn t mean you wouldn t rate it higher it s his opinion and i m sure when you get your hands on it you won t even be thinking about its score,0
wtfff its the greatest spiderman video game ever created and i can admit it as i have played every single series and this one literally changed in terms of graphics and gameplay and you give a damn score lollll,1
that cruise came out of nowhere,0
too much spider not much man ign,0
ign you are really bad at reviewing games,1
spider mans open world doesn t thrillingly have the breathtaking moment of its main campaign it s not suppose to its a story single player experience,0
i would give the demo alone a nine what is this wack score,1
well the score wasn t what i had hoped but this doesn t change my thoughts on the game,0
i dont get decimal score i mean why would you minus for either give or,0
its not on xbox one,0
it would be a but not enough puddles so,1
only hours that s it,0
just watched digital foundry analysis in short sunset overdrive with spiderman skin and e demo still looked better resolution p pro p on ps a fast paced action game at fps no thanks i pass,0
no rtx,0
any one remember spider man the old days on ps simple but we were happy and now great and more happier,1
just enough not enough,1
but ign what do you think it really makes you feel like spiderman,1
complains about difficulty like it s an issue,0
i make this joke once but im gonna make it again geeez i cant wait to play this on my shitbox oh wait,0
no tank battles,0
i want a spiderman game that makes me feel like batman,1
i m waiting for dunkey s review,0
huh and this coming from the same place that gives madden a every year for marginal improvements smdh,0
excellent review and appropriate score,0
everyone complaining about ign reviews why are you watching this,0
this game looks pretty lame,0
hats off to insomniac,0
im hyped af i cant wait,0
nowhere near arkham city i am sad,0
wow all these reviews coming out at once it s kinda crazy,0
hours that s all,0
i really can t wait for this story,0
metacritic ign should ve given a,1
seriously just give it a wierd pricks,0
quick tip when ign uses the decimal system then just round up or down according to the score so a is actually a,0
we did it fans,0
makes you feel like batman,1
too much mary not enough jane,1
another ps masterpiece exclusive,0
so marvel movies should look to these guys on how to make the movies,0
really what did you expect guys,0
should be a there are no microtransactions and the shitty rehashed sport games get higer ratings this game is a love letter to spiderman comic fans its funny though that infamous second son got an and spiderman did too the games are really alike,0
makes you feeeaaaal like spider man,0
i need it now,0
excluding the score for a second johnathon did a excellent job with his review he kept me engaged in what he was saying for the entire minutes,0
gives call of duty a better rating,0
makes you feel like spider man,0
the voice of the reviewer sounds like a peter parker voice actor lol,0
wow that just makes me want to buy the ps pro more holy smokes too many great exclusives and i am stuck on pc gaming,0
hold on you gave madden an but spider man ps gets a,0
not on pc,0
,1
marvel s spider man ps really makes you feel like marvel,0
this review is confusing just get miucin back in there,0
of course it will make u feel like spider man come on guys what do u want them to say of course it is like arkham because that game define the genre give them a break,0
this video makes me feel like batman,0
unsubs,0
warning watch out for salty comments below,0
k boss battle is either a pattern recognition or bullet sponge,0
did you even fukcing finished the whole game you guys make some dumbass reviews just to be the first channel to upload,0
all the dislikes just cause it s not a review hahaha wow,1
ign has to be make parody reviews who writes these lol,0
i hate this fuckin dudes voice,0
arkham knight still better hahhhaha,1
no battle royale mode lol,1
insert superhero video game really makes you feel like insert superhero,0
if someone told me that spider man ps was spectacular i would think that was definrtely over a at least,0
insert out of meme,1
really a dashboard confessional reference,0
so a,0
imsoniac make daredevil please,0
it makes you feel like batman,0
i love how the first words out of this video where this game makes you feel like spiderman lol,0
not quite call of duty,0
the game makes you feel like spiderman,0
to say the least i m fuckin pumped for this game and i m disregarding every negative thing ign had to say about this game even if they re minor i will make my own judgement,0
not call of duty,0
but but ign chan you gave cod,1
,0
i never understood why you give scores like why not just go up to don t get me wrong this is ofc a great score but why not just a and in other reviews also so much more simple to just put one number,0
i will pass i knew the fighting would be repetitive af,0
pre ordered,0
spider man ps makes you wanna buy a ps just to play this game like if you feel the same way,0
boss battles fell the same yet zelda gets a,0
really ign you could ve give the straight,0
ok where s angry joe i need real thoughts here,0
sony saved games marvel from disney,0
too swingy,0
clone saga scarlet spider suit is in the game nothing else matters,0
im really scared of how this game will run and look on my standard ps they really leave standard ps owners in the dark,0
not enough emo toby maguire,0
you spoiled a lot,0
not battle royal,0
sounds like gives,0
where is the raimi suit,0
jonathon could ve voiced peter parker,0
feeeeeeel like spider man,0
drink every time he says feel like spiderman hell of a drinking game,0
so yeah everything is amazing maybe the pace of the story could be a tiny bit bettee but yeah,0
how it got an sry spidey fans but this game is so fking repetitive u literallty finish the game potential in hrs,0
i honestly cant wait to play spider man ps this friday this franchise has been my favourite movie and game but every single thing marvel does is just inspirational and i could not see the movie game industry without this kind of company but spider man just makes me feel like something more great game insomniac this game woudnt be here if it wasnt for you,1
yeaaaah can t wait for this game,0
ign reviews r fake just play it for yourself,0
xbox fans where are you all,0
i recommend watching mr sunday review s review instead,0
laura bailey ftw,0
didn t make me feel like batman,0
ok ign so a basically your point system is pathetic,0
i liked this game better with batman,0
wait at it says classic suit damaged so the question is will it be permanently damaged or will they pull an arkham knight and have a repaired version,0
the infamous spider man,0
automatic thumps up,0
you guys even add some minor spoilers in the video wtf,0
the only thing that i don t like is that spider man stops in the air for a second while swinging,1
why this game is not on pc,0
what a trash review he should be fired for praising a game so highly and giving it score there is no way in hell madden is a better rated game than spider man ign just does garbage reviews,0
batman is still the king of superhero games nice try though hurry up friday i need to play this game,0
i was hoping for a oh well,0
why,0
lol the arkham series is still the undisputed king of superhero games,1
why not just a tf,0
i expected for easy allies to give worse score than ign not the other way around,0
remember the arkham games didn t have phenomenal boss fights either and those games are still amazing it s all about the story,0
spider man s arkham asylum,0
wait there s hardly any side missions i thought this game was meant to be big,0
he mentioned the arkham series at run just shows that the arkham series is now a touchstone for all superhero games,0
can t wait till friday to play this d,0
reminder that ign gave enter the gungeon an for some boring guns so take their reviews with a pile of salt,0
just the fact spiderman has failed to snatch the goty award from kratos now it is up to arthur morgan,0
am i the only one or the graphics is actually looks worst then amazing spider man oh wait i played it on pc,0
i mean i already pre ordered,0
i m just here for the not enough too much ign review comments,0
looks like a solid rental to me,0
the game haven t come out yet why already reveal the game that doesn t out yet you guys are so weird more like you guys are trying to give some spoilers about this game,0
you better be able to wear the sam raimi s trilogy suit,0
should i still pre order this,0
too much red,0
like always ign is a shitty gaming review system they make it seem like a game is great in the beginning then start bashing it with ehhhhhh then there s this and this that ruin it and then they give a weird review score i just like to laugh at them hahaha,0
not enough puddles ign,0
the way he reviewed this game gave me the impression he was going to score it a or somewhere that range,0
lemme guess didnt watch the review yet btw too much spider man,0
hours what,0
hours did you rush through the game because everyone else is saying at least,0
all you spider man bandwagons better not ruin this game plz,0
too much web swinging,0
gaw just give it an or ign,1
you re just using your thumbs to swing around what s the fun with that i don t feel like spiderman at all i m giving this game,0
,0
that s when you know you nailed it when you enjoy the peter parker bit as much as the spiderman parts i think the spectacular spiderman cartoon series did that very well,0
makes you feeeeeeeeel like spider man,0
but does it have puddles,0
but does it make you feel like tobey mcguire,1
but is call of duty truly better than spider man,0
what s with the score after praise are you trying to make yourself seem sophisticated or something chloe rad is bad enough we don t need,0
makes you feel like batma i mean spiderman,0
with the same problems as the batman series spider man also deceives its audience but we here at ign will not be fooled twice there are no spiders in this game,1
i hope this game isn t to easy,0
big fan if spiderman since i was a kid too bad i can t have a ps for what ever the reason is,0
sort of feels like a sponsored review for some reason i know ign doesn t do they that i know of but it still feels off,0
cant wait to see cod score higher then this somhow lmao,0
need tv k for this game,0
doesnt make you feel like batman,0
once he said it makes me feel like spider man that was it really didn t care what was repetitive to them or anyone else i might not even do the missions just swing that s all i care about,0
people here shitting themselves because it got a is a great score,1
too much spider not enough man ign,0
there ya go,0
if you cant spend hours just swinging around the city it s a flop,1
ewww that guy,0
score doesnt seem to add up to how it made him feel like spiderman i would score out of,1
spider man new york city,0
why didn t they get the european dude who narrated the unofficial preview,0
it deserves a at least doesn t do justice to this game if you say you love everything about this game and just because of the pacing issues you tend to give this score isn t right,1
whoz waiting for etika to react not me,0
for everyone who bitched about the puddles,1
do the other suits show up in the cutscenes,1
guys chill a ign is like a or in the real world,1
,1
not enough puddles,1
batman arkham city spider man ps,1
oh come on most of these things are personal problems rather then professional complaints stop being petty and review the game,0
feels like the batman games,1
not legend of zelda botw,1
out of not enough puddles,0
i see no horrible issue just minor and no downgrade so everyone whined for nothing,0
hope it s better than gow horizon hated those games,0

sold,0
the rating zhould at least be,0
boo,0
whoo but no huge negative comment only big positive feedback what made it go lower than too much webs or too much arkham vibe nice ign nice,0
feels too much like spiderman,1
after completing the hr long story mode and most of the side missions people will be bored of this game in a month give or take i bet my kids college savings on it,0
laura bailey is pretty much every female game anime character now,0
i do feel like people will bash about this game for having a score but other sites are giving it or above,1
he litteraly praises the game and gives it a wtf is this they dont know how to score a game,1
does playing video games make you feel like a gamer,0
too much climbing ign,0
can you not spoil the game pls jesus so many spoilers obviously not major ones but jesus,0
i expected tbh,0
if this isn t then ign really needs to evaluate its staff edit ign employees give me migraine,1
man this game should have came out on labor day weekend lol,0
sony have finally done justice to spidy am i dreaming,0
i saw puddles,0
i m not surprised by the score i got a chance to play the game at comic con a few months back and noticed that the side activities in that build felt really mundane and repetitive and that was during a demo build disappointed to hear that hasn t been addressed,1
i recent poll by ign showed that gamers are more excited about this game then red dead redemption and smash are you fking kidding me,0
wow that s awesome can t wait everyone else how dare you not give it a chill out people its not like it got a or something,0
too much spider,0
sooo it s not the masterpiece some people expected it to be but it still looks great and i m sure it will be fun to play soo yeah very excited,0
are you it s not or,0
ign not enough peter parker xd,0
not call of duty,0
the way he is talking during the review you expect at least a lol gonna hurt the fan boys but i m sure it s awesome awesome,0
it s like everywhere else i m reading reviews are scoring it at or above with a select few ranking it below that,0
wow embargo is out,0
didn t mention the downgraded graphics,0
people who barely watch the review and wonder why it got an though the web swinging mechanics are pure awesome indoors especially boss battles in tight spots not so much pacing issues boss battles are one of many ways to keep the player exhilarated after every mission apparently the middle half is devoid of it not only boss battles scenarios and set pieces too only the starting and end consists of any notable challenge boss battles become less and less unique and more repetitive and pretty much the same pattern over and over again the game doesn t encourage to use all the power ups apparently few are more than enough to play through the entire game side quests especially the gang hideout one are boring and repetitive pretty much the exact same as amazing spider man games,1
so far it seems tom holland is the worst peter parker in the franchise s history,0
its time,0
no spoilers,0
not enough spiders man,0
he spoke like he was giving a,1
c mon it s spiderman of course it s going to be under a l,1
what a bad time to be a dc and xbox fangirl right now marvel and sony is killing it,1
this game looks so beautiful my favourite superhero and this looks like his best game yet i hope a stan lee skin,1
cracking knuckles time to overreact and send death threats and say this guy doesn t understand this game cause he left out,0
if it actually makes you feel like spider man doesn t that mean the game does it s job perfectly doesn t it deserve at least a then,0
graphics and look so different pro vs normal ps here,0

here waiting for evan filarca s review,1
first comment,0
hello,0
man chris was such a beast back in the day,0
with the school bus sense when peter was chasing after the bus i was laughing the whole time,0
my all time favourite movie,0
i had the biggest crush,0
people saying fant stic when referring to fantastic,0
to this day this trilogy is awesome to revisit even only spiderman movie to ever hurt me was tasm,0
why didn t peter bandage his arm before thanksgiving dinner in order to keep his dress shirt intact,0
sam raimi spider man will always be the best spider man adaption no matter what if i have kids they are going to watch it and i feel bad for anyone that hasn t,0
i grew up with spider man and the animated series and just rewatched the first one and it still holds up great love the score the story and the action was great and everyone was perfectly casted especially with j k simmons as j jonah jameson,0
i do like in the first amazing spider man compared to the first sam rami film is that we actually see flash gwen and other students have reactions and giving their condolences to peter about uncle ben death i know we get norman osborn in the first film during the graduation but i just wish there was a bit more students and peoples reaction,0
i really enjoyed the spider man trilogy and your reviews one thing i feel like i have to mention as someone with a disability that the word handicap is a little outdated the term that s now being used is people with disabilities and accessibility but besides that i really enjoyed your reviews,0
is it just me or did jake gyllenhaal play peter parker in an alternate universe that could still happen you know tom truly truly plays a wonderful young spider man there are two different interpretations of spider man a young high school peter parker governed by aunt may and curfews and an older married money troubled peter parker with age and wisdom quite well represented in the david michelinie years with the way superhero movies are going they could have two different viable spider man franchises going at the same time spider man kraven s last helen hunt starring helen hunt as peter parker spider man helen hunt as sergei kravinoff kraven the hunter helen hunt as dimitri smerdyakov the chameleon helen hunt as alexei sytsevich the rhino helen hunt as calypso helen hunt as wilson fisk the kingpin helen hunt as mary jane watson parker helen hunt as aunt may parker helen hunt as may parker ii helen hunt as j jonah jameson helen hunt as robbie robertson helen hunt as betty brant helen hunt as glory grant helen hunt as felicia hardy black cat helen hunt as deborah whitman helen hunt as dr curt conners helen hunt as flash thompson helen hunt as harry osborn helen hunt as silvermane helen hunt as hammerhead helen hunt as justin hammer helen hunt as ben urich helen hunt as fredrick foswell helen hunt as montanna helen hunt as fancy dan helen hunt as ox helen hunt as norman osborn helen hunt as mendel stromm helen hunt as nora osborn helen hunt as harried scientist helen hunt as banker helen hunt as security guard helen hunt as security guard helen hunt as neighbor man helen hunt as neighbor man helen hunt as neighbor woman helen hunt as neighbor woman helen hunt as civilian helen hunt as civilian helen hunt as civilian helen hunt as mugger helen hunt as sniper helen hunt as burglar helen hunt as burglar helen hunt as norrin radd helen hunt as mark raxton helen hunt as friendly librarian helen hunt as pizza delivery man helen hunt as professor lambert helen hunt as mephisto helen hunt as angry shop owner helen hunt as little girl helen hunt as wife beater helen hunt as eddie brock helen hunt as concierge helen hunt as taxi driver helen hunt as random ceo helen hunt as madame web helen hunt as madame derriere helen hunt as aunt anna helen hunt as john jameson helen hunt as walt disney helen hunt as the watcher helen hunt as uncle ben s ghost,0
i really did enjoy this movie and peter parker aka spiderman played by tobey maguire he did a great job in this movie and he was awesome for this role and he was badass as this character too and he nailed it as spider man too and mary jane watson played by kirsten dunst she did a great job too as well and she was very good for this role and she is so pretty and very attractive too and i like her as a actress now and norman osborn played by williem dafeo he did a great job as the main villain role for this movie and he was awesome for this role and he sure did a great job as this character too and he was badass for this role and harry osborn played by james franco he did a great job too as well and he did a awesome job for this role and it was nice to see him in this movie too and flash thompson played by joe manganiello he did a good job as the bully in this film role but he was barley in this movie tho but he still did a good job when he was on screen though and betty grant played by elizabeth banks she did a great job too as well and she was awesome for this role and she is so incredibly sexy as hell bro and she is so gorgeous too and i m a huge fan of her now love her to death man and finally j jonah jameson played by jk simmons he did a great job too but he was barley in this movie tho but he still did a great job when he was on screen tho and can t believe it s been years now since this movie was released in theaters back then and that s insane it s been that many decades ago now and i was years old when i saw this movie back then and i was nd grade at the time and i sure do missed those good old classic days back then too and time sure does flies in the movie worlds that s for damn sure chris bro and overall i m gonna give spiderman a stars i really did enjoyed this movie but could of been little bit better if it was longer tho but that s just me though in my opinions and thoughts on this movie chris stuckmann bro,0
,0
hey chris i like spiderman i love the cast too as well i love tobery magure as spiderman and his villan green goblin i like the ending where it in a building thats destory inside it,0
i just watched the whole originally trilogy love the films man,1
best spider man movie,1
face herpes,0
just did re watch of this movie with my kids who got hooked up on spider man because of miles morales nd movie i really like this movie now bud didn t like it at the time i was introduced to spider man while todd mcfarlane was artist i loved venom stories and for me this movie was to bright and colorful now when i actually get to read older comic books and saw all those other movies i really do like this one and nd movie especially the way green goblin was portrayed here,0
this movie is perfect but they need to restore the scenes with the twin towers,1
this movie is still as epic as it was when i saw it as a kid always puts me in a good mood,1
i m one of you guys my dad rented this movie for me in when i was and when that movie ended i couldn t freaking believe what i watched next day i was sick so i skipped school and rewatched the movie all day long only people that watched this as kids know what i m talking about,1
compare this movie cinematography to any hollywood movie they can t get the tone feel the city the style of movie right look at how awesome brooklyn ny looks look even how cheerful fun the vibrant cinematography looks this is why i say this movie captured ny better than any movie closest was taxi driver which was darker but captured the tone perfectly,0
post no way home years,0
spider man and are the best spider man movies to date,1
after all these years willem dafoe is still incredible as the goblin,1
easily the worst spider man movie terribly set up him and mj relationship and did an awful job at setting up peter and spider man at the same time,0
jesus christ loves you all,1
this impression sent me out of my chair laughing,1
,0
the stupidest thing about this movie is when green goblin takes sleepy spider man to the top of that building and tries to get him to join him like there s any possibility that would happen there s nothing goblin uses to try and sway him into joining him and then he just leaves i m sure no one in the audience between that point and when they fought again ever thought it was a remote possibility he would join him they could have at least wrote something in to give spiderman a semi legitt reason to but it s just stupid when you watch that scene worst thing in the first two movies,0
this video just made me subscribe,1
we don t want you to watch green goblin kill all those people but we still kinda did,1
i loved spider man my favorite part of the film was when the green goblin was fighting spider man towards the end of the film the film taught me about teamwork sam raimi s close up shots were amazing too,1
marvel s cinematic universe would never exist if the movie was never made,0
best spider man,1
best movie ever made,1
this film turned years old today i would make a tribute video but i m having problems with my video editing software,0
happy th anniversary spider man,0
i can t be the only person who thinks that the sam raini trilogy of spiderman films are a poorly acted with the exception of jk simmons alfred molina and wilem dafoe the worst offender being the bland and uninteresting tobey maguire who remains monotone throughout b poorly written with the love story between mj and spiderman be beyond creepy and her later ditching of jameson s son you know the astronaut simply cruel to leave him at the altar that is if she didn t love him she shouldn t have let it escalate that far before breaking his heart i would also like to point out that the first two films are nearly identical with the villain s arcs only with doc ock being more likeable before his experiment goes wrong mj and peter getting closer before love confessions at the expense of an innocent harry and jameson s son you know the astronaut as well as the kidnapping of mj and nearly note for note the same power discovery scene yes i understand that it is supposed to be symbolic but to me has always come across as more robotic and rejecting followed by living by uncle bens great power great responsibility motto c woefully scripted how does peter think that learning poetry makes up for being ignorant an unfeeling towards mj even if he was doing it for the greater good mj doesn t know that the characters are also devoid of all subtlety and just state the blindingly obvious with as little inflection in their voices as possible i am well aware that this will be a very unpopular comment have at it these films are only great in concept but after having watched them all i can say is that i find peter a poor role model and again poorly acted so nothing is made up for mj a terrible role model and a walking stereotype and the film overall simply dreary i d rather watch green lantern at least everyone agrees that that was rubbish,1
green goblin is the freaking goat,1
this movie obviously isn t perfect but i still always have a ton of fun with it green goblin is one of my favorite cinematic villains of all time this film has some amazing scenes like the festival uncle ben s death the wrestling match the mirror scene and the final battle i can t explain how much i love this movie just because it s very fun some things are cheesy and dated but that doesn t take away my love,1
i have always loved and still love the power ranger goblin suit my favorite marvel villian ever especially concerning live action,0
the only good movie in the raimi trilogy,1
nowadays the cgi is kinda outdated but the cast and the story still holds up its what set the bar for superhero movies hell theres a movie called superhero movie and its basically this movie,1
to think that now we got holland and zendaya as peter and mj two horrible actors,0
i feel like it s just in danny elfman s blood to compose superhero movies,0
i loved how there was no soundtrack music in the first few minutes of the last fight it was so incredible,0
tom holland,0
i ve always wished that the scene where spiderman finally kicks goblin s ass would ve been a little longer i love this movie,0
i didn t grow up with this movie but i recently finally watched it and although the villain was so good and cgi was pretty good for that time the acting good i don t understand how tobey is seen as the best spiderman by so many his acting just seems so weird to me his expressions and just his way of talking andrew and tom both have for more charisma for me and more realistic as a nerd teen guess nostalgia plays a part,0
i ve always thought the green goblin suit is so badass,1
your mom watched spiderman and x files i thought your parents were strict jehovah s witnesses,0
who is here watching this video after watching no way home,1
aaaaand william daffoe nailed it again,1
i wonder what he was thinking when he found out this was part of the mcu,1
well his opinions are a bit off when it comes to the bus driver if you live in new york it s more likely for a bus driver to not give a shit why idk maybe cause public transportation is more prevalent but if you re from the midwest yeah you d get in trouble that s just not the case when it comes to bigger cities bc they have so much to worry about bc there are so many more people,0
haha nice just finished toby trilogy b waiting for no way home,1
i discovered the spider man trilogy back in i was years old back then and used to stay in hostel so one evening our caretaker we used to call him uncle bought the dvds of the spider man trilogy and showed us the st movie and i was completely mesmerized by it i had never seen anything like it and i spend the night thinking how cool it was and it was summer vacation so we watched the trilogy within days i will never forget that experience and those good times i don t even know how many times i ve re watched the trilogy since then spider man and in particular are some of my all time favourite movies spider man is kind of a mess but honestly i enjoy it lot more than others do nostalgia ofcourse,1
after chris says that first part no way home excuse me,1
amazing to see how much you ve progressed since when this video came out,0
i hate that they tried to sell toby as a teenager dude was like fucking thirty,1
you nailed this review comic books are cheesy and cliche thats why this movie nailed it,1
only complaint with this film is that you can t see willem s expressions through the mask they chose besides the shots where raimi left his eyes mouth visible through the mask it just felt a little too robotic to me for the green goblin as well but i see a lot of ways it wouldn t have turned out as well with a prosthetic or cgi so honestly i don t know if i disagree with the choice overall,1
this movie holds such a special place in my heart like many other movies from my childhood it s awesome how much this one actually holds up watching as an adult the end fight scene is absolutely brutal and i never realized that as a kid,0
no internet in your house at age that must have sucked,0
i like this channel your funny,0
i actually love that green goblin suit,1
that s tv show was great some of the fight scenes were epic,0
i just found your channel yesterday im hooked,1
the internet was huge in come on just because somebody didn t have it doesn t mean it wasn t huge,0
the thing i didn t understand in the amazing spider man with andrew garfield he got bit by a spider so wouldn t he shoot webs like tobey did but he still made web shooters,1
sucks that sony didn t let sam raimi make spider man which was supposed to come out in,1
i think the person s performance that steals the show in this movie willem dafoe s performance as norman osborn and green goblin that s just amazing performing jk simmons is just as good but he did not steal the show away from norman osborn but he s really good though probably the second best character in the movie,0
have you watched the japanese tv show of spider man,0
power rangers were invented from the japanese version of the s spiderman show,0
chris you re the fucking shit dude i love your comment on the power ranger goblin thing,0
it s funny how you say it s happy and stuff and thinking about the last fight between spider man and goblin,0
why does he say the casting is almost perfect who s the miscast,1
rewatched the trilogy in preparation for no way home,0
i agree that no spider man score has been able to match danny elfman s but holy crap james horner s score for tasm is absolutely incredible,1
unpopular opinion i couldn t stand kirsten dunst as mary jane she always irritated the hell out of me,0
the mcu spiderman films are so soulless and dull they do a terrible job in balancing peter s personal life as a student and him being spiderman and there are large sections of homecoming and far from home that are so painfully dull slow and monotonous sam raimi s films are masterful in comparison and are the ones i remember to this day even after watching the andrew garfield and tom holland movies garfield and holland are great actors dont get me wrong but tobey maguire is the absolute goat,0
still my favorite spider man movie,0
for me the raimi trilogy is the star wars trilogy of the superhero genre it will never be topped no matter how hard they might try nuff said,0
i love spider man was a crazy fan of spiderman just because it was too relatable nowadays there is on cgi and jokes at wrong time rather than character development,1
you re the one who s out gobby out of your mind most comic bookish line in a comic book movie ever,1
that evil smile that norman osborn gives in the mirror enough to give a kid or teen in shivers,0
i just watched the first two tobey movies and i really had a great time they just have another vibe that you can t find in those whole mcu monster and btw i tried to watch the garfield s movies but no i could not stand more than minutes don t get me wrong garfield is a good actor but the script of the movie is just doesn t work in my opinion,0
tobey is still the best spider man,0
it really sucks that we couldn t have man i really think if sony had given sam raimi more time he could have made a better spider man also an amazing spider man,0
i loved this film without a doubt my favourite marvel film you care about the characters it has great action and acting one of my most beloved memories of going to the cinema period,0
i just watched this movie for the first time i did not like it very much tom holland is my spiderman this movie was not happy go lucky,0
don t forget it s absolutely heart breaking watching uncle ben die and seeing peter mourn him afterwards you re right the film is fun but i personally think what made sam raimi s version of spider man so good was how much heart it had you cared for the characters there was a sincerity to them that a lot of other superhero films just don t have,1
he wanted to be the green goblin and that turned out so well that kevin feige considered him too good to be recast that s just the highest praise you can get in the comic book world,1
you need to work on your music taste,1
i feel like everyone did the crawl up the stairs thing,0
peter parker s boss is hilarious,1
i remember first watching this movie years ago when i was still to this day it s my favourite spider man movie of all time,0
with great power comes great responsibility this line hits on a personal level straight classic,1
imo i d rather have a robotic green goblin suit than seeing a man run around spray painted green,0
made me laugh,0
we all tried to crawl the wall after seeing this movie yes you did yes you did,1
my grade a,0
j k simmons as jj is so good the comicbook character is now modeled after him,0
so i just rewarded spiderman and i have a theory in the beginning of spiderman peter parker is depressed borderline suicidal it fits well with his behavior at the start of the movie but don t you think it s odd he didn t tell anyone he was bit by a potentially insanely venomous spider wouldn t you want to go to a hospital or even tell a person in the lab that hey your radioactive spider just fuckin bit me he doesn t do anything to help himself he just rushes to his room and seemingly waits to die,0
the raimi green goblin is the best look the character ever had for me it looks good and make sense he s wearing a military suit and has a goblin helmet that fits with it and resembles the masks norman has in his house why would he put a halloweenish goblin costume on top of the suit why would he make a ultra realistic goblin mask with a moving mouth and everything the character would have no reason or motivation and how is this suit sillier than dressing as a fairytale medieval looking goblin i also think the raimi spiderman suit is the best we had on screen it s faithful and original at the same time and it just looks great and when it stands out from the others suits nowadays you look at it and think that s it that looks like spiderman but it s different it has personality that s the movie spiderman,0
yes yes yes and yes love this review,0
we need tobey maguire back full time i enjoy tom holland but damn maguire just had it,0
him i ve always loved spider man me are we brothers,1
spider man wasn t really fun it s was sad spider man are my favourite movies,0
sam raimi s spider man movies and which is underrated imo are the best sm movies,0
was an awesome year i was years old when it came out,1
with your point of dark superhero films i agree to an extent don t get me wrong i love happy movies but the edgier grittier movies are what i really love,1
b for me,1
ah when marvel movies could just be good movies that statement hits home never stopped loving marvel just started hating the mcu lol,1
this is the best spider man movie,1
i did feel like his origins of him getting his powers learning how to control them and the making of his suit was a little rushed but it is much better than the two marc webb movies,0
thank you someone said it toby is the best spider man,1
my childhood is nothing without him,1
the first marvel movie to showcase the flipping pages marvel logo tobey maguire said he had never read a spider man comic book but took the role because he liked the script at around mins the scene in which peter parker catches mary jane s lunch on the tray involved no cgi with the help of a sticky substance to keep the tray planted on his hand eventually after takes he performed the stunt exactly as seen,1
this was my mom s second favorite superhero movie her first was superman the movie,1
the godfather,0
tobey is the og spider man,1
this makes me hyped for dr strange,1
one of the best superhero movies a lot of superhero movies and showss copies the first person superhero narration of spider man s,1
the goblin suit always reminded me of iron man and that makes more sense to me than a rubber mask and tights given the background,1
can t wait for toby to come back,1
ive literally seen a bus driver just move past me even after running had to walk to my next bus stop tobeys peter was basically my bullying experience seeing him get the powers and things work out helped me forget im the geek always chasing the bus,1
the best venom shirt ever period,1
i like all movies,0
jake gyllenhaal was going to be cast as the web slinger till the dork from pleasantville come in,0
watched latest film lt looks like newer one is as good as first one,0
you nailed this review i just rewatched it and was impressed by the directing and acting the movie spends time building the world and developing its characters most movies these days are more concerned with meme humour and are afraid to take themselves seriously possibly to excuse themselves from serious critique,1
organic web shooters are better,1
imagine if peter walked out of the car before uncle ben could say with great power comes great responsibility would he even be a hero,1
since i m back into spiderman i watch the movie reviews and i love watching chris and green goblin does look like a power ranger but i like it better than the comic suit,0
tobey is great,0
kirsten dunst is good and peter and mj are cutesy but she cames off as manipulative in the sequel even in the right,0
i really liked this movie and was happy to see topher grace jump from that s show to this very cool,0
andrew garfield spider man is the worst,1
if it wasn t for spider man there wouldn t be marvel universe,1
some of the best film making in these movies,1
is chris s nose bleeding,1
ha just caught that reference very subtle and clever callback to good dialogue,0
who s here after the confirmation of tobey maguire returning,1
i completely disagree that this movie is purely happy there s lots of scenes that are more dark and dire like all the fights with the green goblin the death of uncle ben and chasing down his killer and willem dafoe going crazy,1
you nailed this video,0
ngl i adore hearing about times when it turns out that an actor that did an awesome job in a role turned out to be someone who really wanted to play said role behind the scenes it s the reason why i love the guy that played the thing in the s fantastic four film as well as willem dafoe its just so wholesome and joyful to hear that these people who did such good work probably did so well because it was somewhat of a dream for them as well,0
i still love these films because the character writing is so personal and so real,1
ah teh memories of the greatest most comic accurate spiderman,1
rip cliff robertson uncle ben,1
the only reason i m not sure if i wanna watch this movie is because it s old so the visual quality isn t great i thoroughly enjoyed batman begins though made just years later do you guys think that s an issue at all,0
i like organic webs,1
chris in early tobey is the best peter parker tom holland let me introduce myself,1
oh chris you sweet summer child you really think that a bus driver wouldn t act like that tell that to my racist bus driver who would call white kids cracker and talk about having sex with his yro daughters friends openly on the bus and as the in house detention baby sitter,0
you should watch the japanese spider man supaidaman it s great for a hilariocity review,0
that s a cute outfit did your husband give it to you when i heard that joke as a kid i always thought he was saying he looked like a girl since i didn t know what gay meant lol,1
best spidermans was tobey maguire ones,1
just rewatched it this is so much better than the new spiderman movies,1
my ranking the amazing spiderman into the spider verse spiderman homecoming spiderman spiderman far from home spiderman the amazing spiderman spiderman,0
love spider man he s been my favorite super hero since i was love chris reviews,0
chris you miss the part where peter miss the bus and had to chase after it who knows the bus driver could be a asshole in hs and a asshole as an adult so it s believable to have it for the story,0
worse franchise ever the guy get amazing powers and decide to go catch criminals bleeeehhh,0
yuri lowenthal is officially the new best spider man in my book,1
i wish i could return to these days i fuckin hate these modern times with social media being an integral part of people s lives to me social media is stupid it s a waste of time and it s contributing to misinformation twerking and all this other teeny bopper shit is also pretty fucking stupid,0
and i know i m looking super deep in to spiderman but really you should it s a film made by people and they really tried to flesh out these characters really well imagine chris saying this to the room lol,1
if there ever was either a true spider man remake or a two part continuation i would love for the new version to open up with spider man at the graves of uncle ben and aunt may and stan lee it would open up for a great monologue about how he lost aunt may and stan to a house fire and then a rain storm forms above peter and what should he see but a flash back to both deaths of dock ock and goblin and have the venom symbiote possessing uncle ben crawl out of the grave and tell peter he failed and then venom ben knocks peter out and then they have the crazy web slinging action of spidy in the black suit and the out of no where attack of harry osborn in the hobgoblin suit and from that point on there is the great mystery of who the new goblin is for the remainder of the film but as the movie would progress we would see black suit spidy turning in d list villains like the shocker and mysterio but every fight peter would become more and more aggressive in the black suit and by the end of the film we see peter loose control of his body becoming venom and beating harry within an inch of his life and it would end with peter taking harry to the hospital it would end with a monologue with peter leaving the hospital and then part four the final curtain would have peter getting rid of venom and venom jumping from host to host eventually getting locked up in the evil corporation from the venom movie and then we time jump to about two years into the future showing new york in an apocalypse and the leader is cleatus cassidy as carnage having an amends to harry and peter and also having them meet venom for the first time and having a one on one fight between venom and peter but there is a massive fight between the three heroes and carnage and the end,1
i really do wish that spider man was split into two parts,1
i am so happy that someone else likes mj in the movie too,1
this movie and spider man are some of my favorite movies ever,1
spiderman remains one of my ultimate favorite movies of all time but i am not a film connoisseur like chris stuckman i would be really interested to know what the small issues are that he referenced in this review to see deeper into one of my favorite movies,0
i never correlated this spider man movie with power rangers idk where that comes from,1
i had that s spiderman theme as my ringtone for a bit,0
boo on your grading,0
fun fact toby maguire actually did the scene where he catches the food in the tray with mj in his arms i took dozens of take,1
i love green goblin s suit its looks freaking awesome,1
rating percentage grade a positives action villain performances story themes emotional comic booky iconic action packed fun pacing exciting puts a smile on my face plot great character development script great origin story musical score great start to the great trilogy great character moments dialogue rewatchable direction writing cast acting suspenseful violent negatives campy mary jane and peter power ranger feel favorite part origin story,1
spiderman was revolutionary and it opened doors to literaly every dumb superhero movie which was hiding somewhere and didn t dare to come out of the shadows and now we have ant man and yes chris back then everyone was climbing walls of their house d,1
fun fact james cameron was attached to this film in the early s,1
imagine a fantastic movie that good can it happen,1
no mention of bruce campbell or weird al,1
please do a review on spiderman movie,1
good job chris,1
you should watch the animated spiderman which ran on fox kids and had seasons i d highly recommend it it s very good,1
why does no one address the fact how peter suddenly got his cool suit in the mcu it s clear that it comes from tony who has the means to create such suit but here it s a bit questionable how peter can suddenly make it,1
this movie is so campy i love it deeply i love both the cd and rd movies as well,1
i actually hate comic book movies but i kinda liked this one it had a unique charm,1
tobey maguire is still the best spiderman fight me,1
spiderman and are the best but is really garbage,1
i think spiderman is better than spiderman,1
ffs why does the green goblin even want to unite w peter what is his aim he already killed the board not mentioned anywhere what else there is for him and why would harry want to kill spiderman not question why his father was with spiderman assuming he was the cause of his death despite knowing him as a hero still like the film but overrated,1
at the time film critics did comment that the scenes between the green goblin and spider man were like watching two people with buckets on their heads,0
i can still hear it,0
i rewatched this movie today so much richer in emotions the action scenes are so good,1
tobey maguire is the worst spiderman he s just not a good actor he gives a really stiff and cringe performance and though it s not perfect his best performance is funnily enough in spiderman,1
i don t know if anyone will see my comment but i want to say this to see what other people have to say imagine if that radioactive spider was not in nyc but in iowa that d be so boring being spider man in a state with nothing in it,0
the second i heard the s live action theme i started headbanging to it,0
did you really say out loud h spider man in the cinema that disturbs other moviegoers,0
you know what before tobey maguire andrew garfield tom holland i mean back in the s they should made a first marvel s spider man movie like casting choice like christopher atkins as spider man peter parker jennifer runyon as black cat felicia tina louise as aunt may michael caine as uncle ben claudia wells as mary jane watson don murray as jona jameson billy dee williams as robbie robertson dustin hoffman as agent nick fury and jennifer beals as black widow even the bad guys like non outer raul julia as dr doom andre the giant as the rhino mark hamill as the green goblin brett cullen as the lizard michael berryman as the vulture gary oldman as the mysterio even the filmmakers like directed by sean s cunningham producer by roger corman executive producer by stan lee albert pyun make up artists by dick smith creature effects by john carl buechler stop motion animator by phil tippett special effects technician by greg jein visual effects by richard edlund production designer by william sandell music by wendy carlos screenplay by renny harlin writer by stanley kubrick professional stunt double by jean claude van damme david prowse and now they call ed it spider man vs doctor doom from new world pictures and association with marvel predictions ltd but this will be the first live action marvel superhero movie called spider man vs doctor doom but the live action marvel movie will be turn out to be a knock off of the empire strikes back and fast times at ridgemont high but unfortunately the s live action spider man movie might be a low budget film because it might be on cable tv network like on hbo and it will be from new world pictures and marvel production ltd not cannon films,0
did you see the new playstation reveal i heard spiderman was there,1
i would have prefered either a goblin who had to take the strength formula that mutated and thus disguised his face that would wear off or to have added in some traditional purple clothing on top of the suit and a pumpkin grenade satchel maybe flight goggles or just a darker less shiny green,0
i hated the casting they look way too old to be playing high school kids,0
dafoe looks just like the real joker make him hapen,0
the way you describe makes me feel like i lived through it when in fact i was only a baby,0
chris ya reviewed this on my birthday your awesome dude,0
my favee,0
one of the best ending sequences in film ever made then roll to credits,0
fantastic review i agree this movie is in my top all time favorite super hero movies and is far and away my favorite spider man film,0
i still rate this as the best of the trilogy peter parker s story is brilliantly told and it helps that the mary jane character comes across as mainly sympathetic in this unlike with the next two movies,1
i love the green goblin suit in spiderman it s my favourite green goblin suit,1
my biggest complaint about the mcu is that the writers arent good at making serious characters so in order to make the characters likable they just make every character unnaturally quippy,1
just watched this video for the fist time and face herpes made me lmao,0
a chris common on,0
saw it in cinema my god was i stunned what a movie oh my god,1
can we all give a moment to realise that chris can actually do a great jk simmons voice as jjj,0
when peter just folk like us nerdy and cringe with none of the backup he get,0
the first spider man i saw was spider man before i saw spider man and,0
man i feel so strongly about sm getting organic web shooters in this movie and feel very sad that they didn t stick to that in the other reboots ver glad to find someone who agrees with me on this,1
the thing about the old spider man movies that i think are missing in the new ones amongst others is the swing spider man swings gives me chills when i watch it i don t feel that anymore with the new movies as i just know it isn t real plus there s no weight no thrill no style in the swings far from home tried to rectify it in the end but still can t be compared to the first three or even andrew s spider man,1
tasm goblin actually looks like a goblin dafoe s costume i mean they made it in so i gotta give them creidt for make it really good when it s in,0
exatcly this looks way more realistic than homecoming,0
amazing spider man is my favourite beating the original just by a little bit somepeople have a go at the homecoming but i reckon it holds up with tasm and even tasm pretty well what do you guys think,0
spider man,0
i rememeber watching this movie when i was or so this review brings back lot of memories,0
i will forever say this film is the best spiderman film better than the sequel,1
so ur rly not gonna say anything about the best suit of all time eh,0
maguire is the worst peter parker we re supposed to believe that this spineless silent person who never sticks up for himself sticks up for everybody else i don t buy it in the sequel he walks away from some guy getting beat up in an alley peter would never do that with or without powers i had to stop watching the video at that point,0
the only thing that really bothered me is that the actors were way to old they all look like they are to years old especially flash,0
the first ever super hero movie that i watched in a theatre was absolutely captivated by everything thrown before my eyes best experience ever,1
great movie but yeah goblin s suit looks terrible i thought that back in as well i would call it perfect if it weren t for that the sequel is perfect,1
do you like this better than homecoming i do,1
spiderman awesome spiderman ii entertaining spiderman iii pretty good amazing spiderman why they make this movie amazing spiderman worst movie in series,1
binging a lot of these because of the quarantine to me tobey is the best spiderman and this was the best movie i forgot how funny it was though,1
i remember spiderman in theaters probably one of the best theater experiences ever,1
i have spiderman on vhs my childhood in the nutshell,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b amazing spider man b amazing spider man d homecoming b far from home a into the spider verse a,1
miles morales tom holland andrew garfield tobey maguire,1
sam raimi tobey maguire danny elfman spiderman,1
no one spiderman shazam,0
the only reason why it would be acceptable for this movie to be like power rangers is basically because spiderman created power rangers if you look at the old japanese show it has basically everything the power rangers has like giant monsters and giant robots and also the show came out before power rangers if you don t believe me look it up,0
spider man director sam raimi producers laura ziskin ian bryce writer david koepp starring tobey maguire willem dafoe kirsten dunst james franco cliff robertson rosemary harris composer danny elfman cinematographer don burgess editors bob murawski arthur coburn production companies columbia pictures marvel enterprises laura ziskin productions distributor sony pictures releasing release date may runtime minutes budget million box office million,1
i was watching this review when suddenly i noticed my trilogy of spiderman movies went like this criminal,0
green goblins helmet is awesome what are people talking about,1
how much money does chris struckman doing this dope job,0
i remember as a kid i dreamt that i was spider man and i was doing that whole climbing for the first time sequence but in my house but i woke up before the woooooohooooo part and the next night i prayed to god that i could continue that dream i prayed so hard was so disappointed the next morning,0
i thought you were a lot older than me then you said you were in and i realized i m older than you way to make me feel old,0
chris stuckmann dane dehaan s green goblin is the best thing about the amazing spider man,0
chris stuckmann i actually really liked dane dehaan s portrayal of the green goblin in amazing spider man,0
don t really think he put his emotion as a kid seeing the movie and seeing it again now he loved it back then so he doesnt wanna change that because it s part of his childhood in my opinion tom holland is the best spdierman then tobey but spiderman doesn t have organic web so by you saying it fits him cuz he doesn t have the money to make web shooters and shit is dumb cuz he had the money to make that nice ass suit and fix it time after time and if he did had organic web how is the web going through his custome when his swinging his protayal of spiderman after he gets bit doesn t really change in the comics and cartoons spiderman gets like a ego confidence boost and in all raimi movies tobey protays him the same kinda wimpy weird kid ass peter and spiderman in the balcony scene that yiu were talking about the bomb my only thing about that is how didnt harry get killed aswell he was literally like feet away from the bomb green goblin and j jonah were amazing picks for actors the power ranger suit is ten times better then herpe face lmfao u didn t seem to mind how all the high schoolers look the teacher was younger then them lol the acting was bad u can see people look jnto the camera atleast to times and in some scene them not really knowing what to do in the scene love your reviews thoe u changed my mind on the amazing spiderman movies lol stuckmann,0
i think he s giving this movie too much credit,1
well here s the thing i too barely had the internet back in the day and i too thought the green goblin looked like a power rangers villain so i get what you re saying with people just piling on the narrative online but c mon that shit was power rangers as fuck and that s not even an awful thing i loved the power rangers growing up too but if you re going to cast willem dafoe and then put him in a mask that hides his face completely and has no good explanation even within the narrative i mean that still kinda sucks that having been said there are large swaths of this movie that are awesome including the characters and especially the acting it never gets enough credit but not only is jk simmons the perfect jjj he even has that moment when green goblin is trying to get peter s name out of him and jonah despite peter literally standing feet away covers for him says he doesn t know who keeps getting the spider man pictures that moment imbues the character with so much humanity the idea that he s a jerk he s greedy he s a little power drunk but he s not a coward he s not going to sell out some kid to save his own skin also i find anyone who thinks earnest but corny teen crushes in movies to be too much are willfully burying their own memories of it good on you stuckmann i also had awkward crushes,0
chris you need to see the spectacular spider man series best spider man series out of all of them,0
i have to say i love this movie so much better then the new movies i didn t really like homecoming because i grew up with this movie and spider man and spider man i just liked them better,0
no spiderman movie will ever feel the same as seeing the first sam rami spiderman,0
batman begins changed the tone of superhero movies forever,1
toby was always my childhood hero that dvd was literally of my life from the age of to,1
tom holland be like,1
tobey was best imo he captured both peter and spider man very well andrew was too hipster skater dude and had too much confidence at least more than tobey s peter parker with calling out flash and that whole scene and tom s well he had iron man tony stark shadowing him a lot which wasn t the case with spider man in general plus tobey s version of self sacrifice with he knows that he has to keep his peter parker and spider man life separate was spot on,1
i just rewatched the raimi trilogy and it made me sad about the mcu i love the mcu but there s a problem we often see the hero s fighting bad guys and saving the day but there s a lack of real heroism i love the scenes where tobey walks into a building on fire trying to save whoever is stuck,1
the review is great but it have some spoiler inside the movie and people at my school wasn t really a director person if they see this review they gonna be so confusing about behind the scenes stuff that you said the footage in this video spoilers movie except i like the part when you say rewatched spiderman and power ranger compare,0
come here after avengers infinity war cause i like spiderman homecoming but spiderman some how is cool in infinity war if i see this review than i try original film for spiderman after infinity war cause spiderman and venom is on my list,0
they made a doctor strange reference in the trilogy at was that a legit shazam reference jk,0
omg watch the japanese spider man and review it please xd,0
but i like it better than face herpes i bet,0
movies these days dont have character development or enough story details it s all rushed spiderman a spiderman best super hero movie ever spiderman c tasm c tasm c homecoming b far from home complicated mehhhh b,0
don t tell harry,0
originally he was suppost to create the web shooters but for some reason they changed it if you watch the first trailers you can see it,0
i just rewatched this for the first time since seeing it in the theatre when it first came out and just like back then i find this movie meh the only thing really great about it in my opinion is jjj i suspect this is partly because i had no nostalgic connection to spider man prior to so all i see watching it is average acting a cheesy villain and sets not in a good way whiny lead characters too much screaming and a boring script sorry to all who love this but i just cannot,1
if it wasn t for spiderman movies like the amazing spiderman would feel the need to properly show how peter parker explores his powers,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman c the amazing spiderman b the amazing spiderman d spiderman homecoming b spiderman far from home b,1
really yas all gunna get upset bout his cool shiit im sad for yas all,0
good review man spider man rami trilogy is my favorite spider man movies tobey is my favorite spider man i even like spider man especially the edit version i made,1
i lost it at face herpes,0
go watch hitop film s spider man the perfect origin part perfect representation about how much i love this movie,0
christmas meat,0
literally me,0
dang i miss sam rami s spiderman films,1
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman c the amazing spiderman c tasm d homecoming b ps i consider this a movie imo a into the spiderverse a venom f far from home a,1
it s just like salty fan boys that thought toriyama made goku the main character of the buu saga over gohan people just love to be gullible and just join the crowd,0
sorry chris but this movie was a bit boring especially the ending fan boy is showing through too much again,0
tobey mcguire was the better spiderman but ironically andrew garfield is the better actor,0
that final hand to hand combat scene holds up today its absolutely ruthless i still remember seeing that scene as a kid with the grenade blowing up in the reflection of spider mans eyes and being blown away,1
spider man perfect casting and plot spider man this was perfect spider man it used to be my favorite spider man no joke the amazing spider man not amazing but not bad the amazing spider man i refused to see this and just wanted tobey maguire back homecoming who the hell are you i want tobey back far from home you really think you re spider man your version has aunt may as a sex toy and uncle ben got decimated before thanos showed up i want tobey back i only seen hoco and far from home because my sister dragged me to them and i figured they d be handy for ranting,0
i would never forget the scene where peter crawls the wall for the st time when peter goes after uncle ben killer and the web swinging at the end that blew my mind,0
scooby doo skeletons put it in cgi can t get better than this i mean look at how good that scorpion king was sam rami,0
i think your mom just had something in her eye,0
great movie i actually like it more than spider man,0
spiderman batman rest of superheroes,1
i like this version of spiderman because it follows the comics he s not selfish he s just a guy that s trying to do the right thing and just has bad luck that in essence is what spiderman is,1
spiderman is what got me interested but i think it was underworld that started my filming education,0
green goblin turning people into skeletons is silly because it s sam raimi lol,0
you got me rolling,1
bro do reviews on tv show impulse,0
love that you have goldeneye in your nintendo,1
i remember willem dafoe being terrifying as goblin i was like when i watched it and had it on dvd and watched multiple times,0
this my favorite movie of all time thank you for reviewing it i loved how it was a superhero film and did not apologize for being so i loved the acting the fights the special effects awesome and return of the jedi is my favorite star wars film,1
tom holland is spidey how i pictured him in my head perfect but i can not describe the feeling i had watching this movie as a year old back in,0
there was actual clapping at the end of this movie in my theatre and not just by me,1
so you re ok w whimpy spidey garfield was the best peter parker,0
really spider man is the reason why i hate spider man when i was a kid,0
i like spider man,0
the best spider man and the best director back then movies had a sense of purpose they had adult content they were moving and full of love on screen and in the making mcu is just autoreferential and diversity based and worst of all unmemorable stuff now made just to cash in on the too many casual viewers just looking for a laugh it s sad that they can decide for us who respected these movies,0
i would love to see power rangers zeo teamup with batman and spider man to fight against rita repulsa lord zedd goldar scorpina rito revolto the green goblin and the new monster what do u think of that please tell me,0
some bus drivers would,1
i was kind of avoiding this guy for a bit because i figured he was one of those annoying boring movie reviewers i misclicked onto this video now i think i might subscribe,0
do punisher,1
yet again nobody realizes that the webs come through his wrist but there is no way for it to come out through his suit,0
i agree with everything you said it s truly an amazing movie sam raimi is a complete genius as a kid he was my favorite superhero so when this came out it was huge for me too he still is my favorite superhero,1
the green goblin suit never bothered me until people started bringing it up,0
this was the first movie i went to see in theaters with my father,1
shazam opss wrong movie,0
i went to a drive in for the first time to see this,0
i was when this movie came out and it blew my mind my first superhero movie,1
thank you i thought i was only one i love spider man to death,0
organic web shooters more realistic lol i love it and totally agree,0
true story my high school bus driver actually did that to me in freshman year i had to wait hours for my dad to pick me up from school,0
i m gonna get fired later,0
yo thats a jet force gemini,0
loved this movie only issue was that green lantern suit not an opinion from the internet me and my boys use to joke on it back in the day saying the movie was so good we forgive the suit completely,1
fuck the mcu,1
i actually just like all of the movies and actors as they bring their own merits to the table,0
is it just me or does chris head get larger as the video goes on,0
watched all three movies when they came out in theaters the rest i watched on dvd i saw far away from home in a theater because my son wanted to see it none of the not sam raimi movies gave me the feels i got from watching his movies i did see into the spider verse and it was good seeing a spidey that was reminiscent of tobey s and would love to see another spider verse movie with him again,1
it s not like i thought it was perfect then but man did they nail the tone more than anything spidey before that the first is still my favorite,0
you haven t taken a bus here in mexico have you completely realistic,0
my rankings spider man spider man ii spiderman iii,0
he s got the n james bond in the background,0
first movie i saw at the movie theater but in spanish,0
first movie i saw at the movie theater but in spanish,0
before watching this review i didnt know people had anything to complain about this movies like those movies were the gold standard for great comic book movies for quiet some time and they hold up today pretty well never ever would i have thought people would nag on those lol,1
,0
dafoe was amazing this is the best spiderman i do love the wimpy mcu holland spiderman but to someone who has been reading spidey since the s the tobey nailed it,1
did you know that spider man and evil dead are in the same universe,1
i will review amazing spider man when i get back from canada well tomorrow is my last day from canada so i may or may not post it tomorrow,1
i just rewatched this after so many years and i love some of the horror elements in this movie like peter s dna transformation scene and after so many mins of fun theres a legit jumpscare that completely got me as a kid my nitpick that maybe you saw too is how did peter not realize that norman was the green goblin they establish goblin knows who spiderman is but peter doesnt know who norman is it couldve been explained if maybe he thought that norman and the goblin were working together but oh well the movie surrounding that is so goood,1
this and spiderman are still my favorite superhero movies favorites movies of all time and great review chris,1
every actor in this film is brilliant and looking from its still stands up,1
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man b spider man homecoming a yet to see far from home so i ll edit my opinion when i see it,1
the end fight is the best in any superhero movie,1

i remember going to the cinemas when i was like with my mother and watching this movie greatest cinematic experience in my life ever and i ve seen a movie or two,0
you are cute,0
u were a weird kid,0
younger nicholson could have done the role of green goblin nicely too,0
watched this review as soon as i saw j k simmons in far from home,0
honestly i dont understand the hype with these old films they genuinely suck the writing the acting the cheap cheesy cgi i get it i was around when this first one came out and yeah it was an exciting time but looking back now it was really awful lol,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man spider man homecoming spider man far from home sorry if i offend anyone with my ratings of the mcu films but there s something about them that makes me love them so much,0
j k simmons is still jj jameson,1

i feel like your favorite spider man is gonna depend on when you grew up because there are two amazing options,0
i guess peoples standards changed over the years cuz when i rewatch this movie id say its pretty dark compared to any standalone mcu movie like the final fight is peter getting rekt and theres blood his suit gets destroyed goblin straight up kills himself and you dont see mcu fights like that really,1
willem defoe as green goblin is unmatched,1
hey freakshow,1
dude where did you get that shirt,0
man i record i was or and saw the poster of the movie and didn t t have money to go and see it i watch it way later when i got a pc and internet and downloaded it beautiful times,0
agree with pretty much everything you said in this video,0
yep,0
if you didn t do it you failed as a child,1
never thought green goblin suit was power rangers pretty sure those same folks would think animated series outfits would be the same,0
pizza time,0
we need organic web shooting to come back,1
fleshed out,0
something that i didn t like was the acting in the movie besides willem defoe but other than that i m gonna give this movie an a,0
blade actually saved marvel they were about to file bankruptcy before blade smashed the box office,1
did you see my youtube channel,0
as far as the characters being almost perfect i would agree i consider tobey maguire s spider man to the equivalent of michael keaton s first batman nothing compares so william dafoe he s practically a god i loved his comic book take on the green goblin absolute perfection im years old i remember as an year old watching the cartoon obsessively with my dad i absolutely adored spider man i agree with every point he has the and i still love watching the tv show today,0
i love this movie to this day and i love the green goblin suit it was brought into the movie as a power suit for the military so i don t mind it looking like power rangers,1
i think you just described what a meme is,1
i love spiderman i don t like superhero films usually or i didn t like them but back then i only ever watched spiderman until i watched every marvel movie ever in last couple of months,0
can you do more s like movie,0
tobey was the best spider man,1
this is my favorite movie ever when it came out i was holy moly was in awe i related to the characters and loved the adventure even so much i was able to get a piece of the spider man suit from spider man still one of my prized possessions lol,1
my parents watch this when they were just dating and that s the reason why i m obsessed with these superhero movies,0
but dude tobey is acting he s getting a check of million dollars,0
oh the kid with the jelly donut,0
nostalgia critic thought dafoe was overacting the green goblin but to each their own,0
with all the memes and other shit i actually forgot how much i loved this movie when it first came out i just subscribed a little while ago and am now binging some of your work and i gotta say i am impressed especially with this review specifically for making me remember that tobey as spiderman was probably the best thing to happen to the character ever i love tom holland as spiderman he s great but he s no tobey maguire it s like comparing ben afflecks batman to michael keatons batman i personally adored ben as batman best i have seen in years but he was no michael keaton imo tobey is the og and his movies were great anyway on to the next spiderman video,1
why didn t raimi want willem dafoe dafoe is one of the best actors ever he was the only great actor in deathnote lmao,1
face herpes,1
whatever life holds in store for me i will never forget these words with great power comes great responsibility this is my gift my curse who am i i m spider man,1
i actually liked the green goblin s suit,1
wrong movie,0
im yrs late to this but really enjoyed your review i was also when it came out and was big on the s and s cartoon and ya this movie was a game changer for me as was spiderman but for all the wrong reasons i also had stupidly huge crush on a girl at the time and remember feeling like this was one of the only movies id seen that captured that convincingly harder to convince me that parkers unpopular when hes andrew garfield p,0
great review noticing the dinner suits is brilliant and eye opening raimi is an artist,1
am i the only person that was jarred when peter killed the robber,0
i haven t seen spider man since that one time in but holy crap i never realized how bad green goblin looks,0
btw don t suppose you mind reviewing ang lee s hulk film from,0
this was the first spiderman i saw ill never forget it it will always be the best spiderman movie for me as a kid,0
great great review spider man was to me one of the best cinematic experiences of my life because it was the first time that i saw a comic book hero done right yeap i really think that tim burton s batman is an over hyped movie that is not an adequate representation of the character or his world your review is really on point on all the goodness that this wonderful movie has to offer,1
my favorite spider man film by far what a masterpiece seriously,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man d spider man homecoming c,1
my parents bought me spiderman for my th birthday i didn t normally get gifts,0
dialated pupils,0
awesome movie the spiderman movie,0
it was like frozen for the boys,0
best origin story i still prefer this over spider man don t get me wrong both are super fun you feel the passion of remi behind the scenes and the ideas,1
i guess i am the only person who actually loved the amazing spiderman and couldn t stop talking about it too all my friends,0
honestly i loved the first spiderman movie but i loved the second and third one far more,1
spider man a a really good movie and also a classic spider man a a really goood movie but i like as much as the first one spider man b i don t think it s bad but its a pretty decent movie and also an entertaining one the amazing spider man b meh not good not bad it s just a shallow spider man movie that was okay you ll still get a good kick out of it the amazing spider man d its the worst spider man movie it fails at every thing except the romance that was pretty good but everything else was awful spider man homecoming a it was pretty good it just felt to me like a another marvel movie its better than tasm and spider man but not the other ones into the spider fucking verse a i never thought there will be a spider man movie as good as the first two it was fucking awesome i don t have one best spider man movie i have best spider man movies i just can t rate one of them above the other so my favourite spider man movies are spider man spider man and in to the spider verse venom i have to say i loved this movie for me at least i preferred it over spider man homecoming but thats just my opinion i will give it a solid a my ranking spider man and into the spider verse venom spider man spider man homecoming tasm tasm homecoming kinda of disappointed me my favourite thing about it was tom holland s performance and keaton s but far from home is looking great i will say it will pretty damn good,1
face herpes lol,1
mcu spider man is the best,0
the goblin is tearing the shit out of him that was a funny way to put it love these reviews solid channel,1
a come on man give it an a spider man is an a,1
i also like the fact they filmed peter parker s life before he received his powers when he was the underdog so by the time his got his his powers you were rooting for him because of your emotional connection to the character,1
your right you don t want too many jokes in a comic film because it can lose it s intensity,1
this film was great because you get a chance to see the emotions that spider man is feeling when he saves people an example of this is when uncle ben told him with great power comes great responsibility not only was this one of the best lines in cinematic history but it was the driving force behind spider man s heroics in my opinion this is the best overall marvel movie because it has all of the essential components to a great super hero film,1
for the grade,1
great review i love this movie,1
i always forget about the skeleton thing that s really weird maybe showing people dying in a fire high above the city thanks to a flying criminal wasn t that great after,1
here s my ranking from worst to best the amazing spider man the amazing spider man captain america civil war avengers infinity war spiderman homecoming spiderman spiderman spiderman,1
hey after seing tom holland s perfomence i can say he is the best caster acter of spiderman he does a amazing job we do not speak about the amazing serie cough,0
i can t believe that i m gonna sound this old now but this is the real spider man man being years old back when and seeing your biggest hero on the big cinema screen i lost it i remember the entire day when we went and saw it and then when i came home one day and found the vhs of the movie on my bed i cried out of joy yeah man those were the days,1
i don t know if its just me but i like the idea of a more serious spiderman movie that s why i loved sniping raimi s movies because spiderman isn t all goofy and a funny character this is a serious movie and i love it,1
i m french and i ve understood everything love you,0
i never understood why people liked spider man more than spider man,0
this movie will always have a place in my heart,0
cough andrew garfield as spiderman cough,0
i m just curious watching this review back with into the spider verse recently released had the film been live action would maguire have returned as an older peter like the one miles hung with,1
fun fact the japanese spider man tv show was a big inspiration for the power rangers,0
my favorite superhero movie ever,0
your,0
just a cool fact but in japan around the s they had a spidey show too and because of the japanese spiderman show we now have power rangers p s in the show spidey fought in a giant robot and the villain turns like feet tall like in power rangers to fight spiderman,0
yes this is the best spider man movie,0
the actors born for their roles were dafoe as goblin and jk simons as j jamesson,1
have you seen spider man homecoming cuz peter he make he own web fluid,0
my favorite thing about spiderman was the score,0
when i first saw the trailer in my holidays were goin on and me and my brother were watching the animated series of spiderman on fox kids and during the break i asked my brother what if there d be a spiderman movie and fuck as i finished that sentence the trailer for the movie popped on my tv screen i was so hyped to see it lol we were like literally jumping around the house,1
look i m gonna be honest tobey is a good peter andrew is a good spider man tom is good at both tom is just acts the most like comic spider man if you ask me and he looks most like teen peter parker out of them all and his conflict doesnt feel cheesy like tobey or stupid and dumb like andrew it feels like troubles a teen would actually go through he doesnt seem like a caricature he seems like a teen who got powers but still has to struggle with the things teens actually trouble with school romance family and work tobey just has a job he doesnt focus on family as much he doesnt seem to have troubles with school and romance is the only one of these problems he truely actually deals with,0
the kid with the jelly donut is the real hero of this movie,0
the final fight in this movie is really underated,1
bruh that was not real you can see the unnatural movement of his head in relation to his body looks like it was doctored in plus if he was simply turned sideways he must be the sickest core strength ever because no one could move inches above the ground crawling that gracefully especially with gravity working against you,0
i actually have a replica of the wrestler suit from this movie,1
i like to think the bomb thingy that turns those guys into skeletons is a reference to army of darkness,1
shooting webs out of his hands is more realistic than web shooters p still love these movies tho they re the best spider man movies ever great review too,1
this review was almost as satisfying as theneedledrop s review of to pimp a butterfly,1
gotta say being a dick is the point of the quips spidey uses it as a form of psychological warfare kind of how like tim duncan would be stone faced all the time when he played in the nba except when he got called for bogus fouls he d dunk on you stuff you at the rim and then just sprint back down the court that must ve been unnerving,0
there is a better song than the score in spiderman spider man spider man does what ever a spider can spins a web any size catching criminals just like flys look out here comes the spider maaaaaaaan a anyway we caaaaaan a here come the spider maaaaaaannnnn,0
also how is spiderman on youtube it s been close to twenty years since it s release over priced much again love your reviews chris had to edit this since i just found out that spiderman is wtf why is the first movie so expensive hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaha,0
awesome review man,0
you didn t have internet in how,0
pizza time,1
this one is still my favorite,1
we all love chris stuckmann,1
a huge part of this is nostalgia like what other critic would point out seemingly meaningless costume choices and say it s so cool that they did that even if it doesn t mean anything for the fans this is also one of the most important movies in my life and it s still one of the best spiderman adaptations in any medium spiderman is absolutely iconic and has a huge bearing on my love of superheroes and cbms no hate,0
i watched this film for the first time recently and i heard no one talking about it so ye green goblin s suit immedeatly jumped at me and made me question my film choice not in any way a chain reaction of the internet also golden eye is not a good game,0
what makes this the best spider man is that the scene with him catching mj and the food was actually him catching the food and it took so many takes,0
holy crap chris is younger than me,1
i don t care what anyone says toby maguire will always be spider man,1
i love this green goblin costume it makes me think of like its armor for his glider,1
agreed with everything you said man,0
humongous what humongous what,0
i was born in and this used to be my favorite movie i wanted to be spiderman i knew every line from this movie as a little kid i watched it so much as a little kid i actually liked the ending scene where spiderman gets brutally beaten up because he comes back so strong,0
dinner scene meaning peter gud norman eviiil harry both,1
shazam its a reference,1
spider man a spider man a spider man b the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man f,1
i can help this guy,0
sadly the mcu will never be like the old marvel this movie has some super brutal moments unfortunately even the newer spiderman movies didn t have the brutality that this one has sigh,0
does anyone else actually like that goblin costume,1
best to worst imo spiderman spiderman spiderman homecoming spiderman amazing spiderman amazing spiderman,0
raimi s movies are straight garbage kirsten dunst was a horrible mj who was far removed from the comics version as was tobey also tobey s acting takes were sometimes unbearable i can t even bear to watch dafoe overact the hell out of his villain role it holds up fairly well even the people who i ve known a long time who loved it in the early s acknowledge now that it blows the cg was always horrible but now it s just laughable stuckann voice i give spider man a d,0
tasm goblin was soo terrible,1
tom holland is the best spider man fight me,1
am i the only one ho actuly like the amazing spider man,0
my ranking tasm bad tasm ok spiderman good spiderman homecoming great spiderman great spiderman masterpiece,1
it s a radio active bomb,0
spiderman homecoming is the stupidest spidey movie,0
not only the best spider man movie but the best superhero movie i m sorry but it is sue me,1
the new ones got nothing on the tobey maguire ones,1
okay my opinion is that tobey maguire s trilogy was amazing at humanising spider man and making people care and relate to peter parker andrew garfield s movies were pretty bad at portraying peter parker and making him relatable and didn t show spider man s core values that well but it did show how spider man is funny and his intellect when he creates his web shooters,0
these movies teach good lessons and especially warned me of fake news,1
i grew up with these movies watched the first one when i was still watch the movies at least once evry weeks,0
perfectly explained review of this movie i m going to watch more videos of you cause you have some spot on stuff,0
i love your giant dutch statue in the background i agree with you about the quality of this film i revisit it every year,0
chris when i was a kid stuckmann,0
i come from the far future civil war is great insomniac s game is also infinity war happened thanos he balanced the universe oh and superman and batman called it quits and left the dceu,0
fruitcake,0
tom holland best,0
yes i love the natural organic web it s like one of the things i wish they had done with spider man in the comics since the beginning i really love the green goblin suit yes its cheesy but it works and the glider is very menacing as well,1
has anyone noticed that he swears more when he reviews childrens films,0
civil war is the best spiderman movie don t me,0
s was good but cheesy costumes and quirks kinda campy jonah jameson awsome s massive leap forward really good with moral grey area s is a little too much should have split it to give each character enough development dancing scene isn t absurd to me bc that would be a definition of bad depending on how you grow up e g if you grow up skipping school and trying to be a cool kid and being a rebel it doesn t seem bad if you grew up generous and somewhat sheltered and goody being rebellious and provocative would be bad they did screw up venom though as eh i don t dig this edgy assholes peter why is popularish plot kinda dumb and i hate when spidey cries because his leg got shot smh he can survive an explosion without going owe as ugh so bad i don t even remember it mostly got action scenes cools but everything else sucks ass homecoming very good but idk why aunt may is so much younger do snt look like an aunt more like a milf great chemistry with best friend power sway changes too much good villain but wish he was more fleshed out to have greater sacrifice,0
it did get a tad bit dark at moments,0
i have been a fan of this movie for a long time second movie is even better and to me is one of the best ever made character development and plot exposition is superb great video,0
great jk simmons impression,0
my biggest issue about this movie is how rushed it is curtain things are just thrown at you through montages that are edited in a comic book way which i thought was pretty charming but overall this movie does very much move like a comic book and at times it becomes its greatest flaw cause sometimes you have to decide which is more important being a movie or a comic book,0
spider man gets an a from me,0
loved this review and totally agreed,0
the best comic book movies imo x men days of future past spider man the dark knight spider man iron man superman deadpool x deadpool x men apocalypse logan the avengers batman superman x men first class captain america winter soldier captain america civil war the dark knight rises spider man the avengers infinity war etc etc,0
shazam,0
i think the saim raimi s are pretty good,1
best spider man film spider man i like but i find it overrated best spider man tom holland just slightly better than tobey best peter parker tom holland,0
spider man spider man spider man,0
i offered you friendship and you spat in my face,0
and by the way you kind of look like tobey maguire,0
gosh i got misty eyed just hearing you talking about uncle ben s scenes this movie was huge for me back in the days i had a friend that got his hands on a pirated version of spider man even before it was released in theaters so i watched the movie first on his tv screen it was so good i got to see it again in theaters nonetheless and it was the first time since s superman that they got the superhero costume straight from the comic book awesome review,0
yeah i had a crush on a girl she sat next to me in a computer class i didnt look at her like i was watching schindlers list with my mouth open a little thats just weird,0
heres what i really dont like about the spiderman trilogy it is really really really corny its not like a rocky corny or batman corny or even really a school play level of corny this is like a full house level of corny,0
i love this channel but i think you re being a little biased on this one probably the nostalgia the movie gives yu but its an awesome movie but there are aspects that do not hold up today and yu just defended a bunch of criticism and said nothing but good things not your usual pro con thing,0
wow i forgot how beautiful kirsten dunst looks in this movie,0
face herpes shit killed me,0
i didnt find the spiderman movies cheesy i mean the suits were pretty funny but it was pretty cool,0
please review spider man ps hype,0
ah the plasticmovie come on it s shitt,0
spider man spider man homecoming spider man amazing spider man amazing spider man,0
i want that venom shirt give it to me now or i will eat everyone you love turning you into a limbless turd floating in the wind,0
yes,0
the green goblin at his creation doesn t make much sense why would a rich industrial scientist make a flashy costume like that a night cap and one piece bathing suit with booties taking up the persona of a mythical creature you would think something more iron man tech looking would come out of that in this iteration at least rami tried to make sense of it all implementing the schizophrenic or did caused from the pressures of his situation the mask was symbolic to having a psychotic monster brewing inside him he was acting out of stress and insanity caused partly from the serum and his life its like the goblin created the mask for him maybe the goblin is who hes been all all along just needed to be drug induced to let it out,0
this movie allowed my balls to drop i went from watching lion king over and over again to watching spider man over and over again,0
you ve definitely never met any bus driver i ve ever had lol,0
spiderman spiderman spiderman tasm tasm spiderman is a film i enjoy but its a mess of a movie tasm was good when it was the relationship thing but everything else was mediocre with the plot being a pile of shit i didn t enjoy it but it s still a better film than spiderman on paper just less interesting,1
i would give it an a,0
agreed,0
this was done well,0
the s animated spider man series was dope,0
man the first spider man is a classic,0
j k simmons as jjj is the best casting choice of all time,0
i don t get why people hate william defoe and his outfit love it it was intimidating cool and awesome i watched this when i was all the till today,0
tobey is still the best spider man to this day,0
spider man is an amazing movie they paid tribute to this iconic character it has awesome fight scenes the characters are fleshed out and you care about them and finally the the film has one of the best spiderman costumes,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man b spider man homecoming a,1
i still enjoy this movie despite being in th grade when it came out and i still think tobey was the best on screen peter parker,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man spider man homecoming,0
i love spider man from it is one of my favorite movies of all time,0
shazam,0
honestly tho as someone who s never had abs and has always worn glasses i can guarantee i d have the same reaction if one day i just woke up with the ability to see and was totally ripped,0
honestly this and spider man will always be the best spider man films ever made homecoming was sooo overrated,0
this movie is my childhood just rewatched it and it still holds up great characters and direction maguire holland i m gonna watch again tomorrow,1
up up and away web,0
spider man is amazing,0
you re jj accent was on point dude,0
a you know nothing for a fact literally nothing reality is subjective none of us know anything for a fact including whether or not we exist at all b you know nothing for a fact about bus drivers maybe it s just because you re so young but you ll eventually realize your experience does not represent everyone s experience there are scumbag bus drivers just like there are scumbag everything else it s not wise to let your biases dictate how you view the world c you ll likely never see this but if you do meh,0
your mom clearly saw you as being spider man from your days of playing and saw him getting punched in the movie and felt like it was you getting punched thus she closed her eyes,0
i remember leonardo dicaprio was first linked to being peter parker,0
willem dafoe is great as norman osborn,0
i love the goblin suit the comics look would look ridiculous,0
fair review good job,0
i m glad he doesn t quipp often because in spider man homecoming his quipping is really annoying i get it he is only but i m as well and if i had the powers of spider man i wouldn t be that annoying and cocky,0
do the world a favor and grab that copy of skyfall off of your shelf throw it in the garbage,0
oh my god that shirt so awesome,0
excellent review and i guess i m lucky to have never watch the power rangers makes the green goblin suit seem just fine,0
i grew up with this movie and that s why spiderman will always be my favorite hero,0
the raimi s triology is the best spider man movies to date the third included and ill tell why the first was so fresh so new almost perfect i lry felt like reading a comic book not watching a movie its just a love letetr to what the comics are second is one of the best super hero movies ever made just perfection from peter confessing to aunt may that he caused uncle ben s death her speech about heroism and sacrifice the inner conflict between peter and his morals shown as uncle ben the he is just a kid no older than my son scene the scene where he sees a guy beeing beaten and he feels guilt for not helping the fire building scene where he saves the fgirl and again feels guilty for those who died in the fire third one had so many issues but it had very much potential with sand man who had good story and emotional background harry who could have been best antagonist ever to face peter if he became venom instead of eddy especially after the development in the movies his hate for both spider mand and peter was so well done at the same time the brotherly love and loyalty between them very complex you couldn t tell wich side of the relationship would win reminded me of creed and logan in x origins as brothers magneto and professor x plus the score of danny elfman all mighty as a matter of fact the raimis movies had clear messages with great power great responsibility there is a hero in all of us keeps us honest gives us strength makes us noble even though sometimes to do what s right we have to be steady and give up things we want the most even our dreams whatever comes our way whatever battle rages inside us we always have the choice to do what s right the choices make who we are and we can always choose to be the best of ourselves these values and morals define what it means to be spider man tasm was a midfing to all the spider man characters though i like andrew as an actor he is the best one of them just sucks as peter and it wasn t his fault maybe the scene when he was humiliating flash or the thug was awful i couldn t take it i like the scene when he is with the little kid in the second movie where he fixes his toy just u get to see peter acting like the good person he rly is very accurate to the character shows it wasn t his bad but script and movie sucks homecoming has the best actor as spider man and peter ofc not because he s the greatest but because tobey isnt that good and andrew was limited with the movies range and one of the best movie supervillains that keaton nailed tobey is the second best actor as spider man after holland and rd as an actor overall but what makes the first ones so good was the story it has so much heart you felt the burden to be spider man and the real weight of with great power comes great responsibility his morals codes and will to help are tested over and over its not supposed to be fun homecoming and i didnt mind the lack of jokes caus spider man is a character of heart and sacrifice with so much drama like daredevil not humor and sarcasm deadpool tony stark dr strange in fact he uses jokes to hide his fear and keep calm so he won t use his full power which may kill so it s not for the sake of just beeing funny well at least the real original spidey not the clown of newer versions andrew and holland if given the good material script could make a better spider man the childish tone of homecoming was annoying spider man is the most heroic one of the mcu heroes even more than steve steve has lot of courage and heart shown in i could do this all day scenes but he ll always be a soldier if he needs to kill he will which isnt a bad thing bad the naive and soft side of peter a normal kid makes him more human and touches me more so i hate seeing him beeing a small one between giants and getting treated like a kid,0
when i first watched this movie i literally though harry and normal were related xd,0
i watch these spiderman views about once a month,0
i hate these spider man movies,1
i really like the green goblin suit in this movie,0
i think of jack nicholson as the green goblin as well william defao,1
the live action show was that the japanese one,0
for me it s hard for me not to think about my childhood memories while watching this,0
i love this movie so much it brings back memories so much time,1
great review,0
i think u re just wearing ur nostalgia goggle praising this film like crazy talking about ur childhood moments the entire friggin time believe it or not u re bashing the amazing spiderman like hell now bcause u were already a grown ass adult by the time it hit theaters would have been an entirely different experience for a kid to watch it by his her age raimi s and webb s spiderman both unique in their own ways and have flaws just like any other spiderman that will come out in the future i don t think u ve given enough credit to webb s spiderman just because his version didn t appeal to u as much but tbh it s got a pretty distinct style and characteristic to its own universe that not many superhero movies have,0
from spider man to infinity war,0
oof this video is radical,0
i like the little one liners you do before the jump cuts like yeah better than that ahhaha,0
the raimi s triology is the best spider man movies to date the third included and ill tell why the first was so fresh so new almost perfect second is one of the best super hero movies ever made just perfection third one had so many issues but it had very much potential with sand man who had good story and emotional background harry who could have been best antagonist ever to face peter if he became venom instead of eddy especially after the development in the movies his hate for both spider mand and peter was so well done at the same time the love and loyalty between them very complex you couldn t tell wich side of the relationship would win reminded me of creed and logan in x origins as brothers plus the score of danny elfman all mighty tasm was a midfing to all the spider man characters though i like andrew as an actor he is the best one of them just sucks as peter and it wasn t his fault the scene when he was humiliating the thug was awful i couldn t take it i like the scene when he is with the little kid in second movie as much as the fire building in s m acting like the good person he rly is very accurate to the character shows it wasn t his bad but script and movie sucks homecoming has the best actor as spider man and peter ofc not because he s the greatest but because tobey isnt that good and andrew was limited with the movies range and one of the best movie supervillains tobey is the second best actor as spider man after holland and rd as an actor overall but what makes the first ones so good was the story it has so much heart you felt the burden to be spider man and the real weight of with great power comes great responsibility his morals codes and will to help is tested over and over its not supposed to be fun homecoming and i didnt mind the lack of jokes caus spider man is a character of heart and sacrifice with so much drama like daredevil not humor and sarcasm deadpool tony stark etc in fact he uses jokes to hide his fear and keep calm so he won t use his full power which may kill it s not for the sake of just beeing funny well at least the real original spidey not the clown of newer versions andrew and holland if given the good material script could make better spider man the childish tone of homecoming was annoying spider is the most heroic one of the mcu heroes even more than steve steve has lot of courage shown in i could do this all day scenes and is a soldier if he needs to kill he will wich isnt a bad thing bad the naive and soft side of peter makes him more human and touches me more so i hate seeing him beeing like a small one between giants and getting treated like a kid,0
you know i would climb on top of some big popcorn jugs or a counter and would yell tally ho ah my childhood,0
in the scene where he is crawling up the side of the building for the first time it shows how he s able to climb with the needles coming out of his fingers but not on his feet so i guess he is crawling up the side with only his fingers and i assume in the suit the needles come through the gloves,0
when people say tobey maguire is the best peter parker while andrew garfield is the best spiderman i completely disagree tobey maguire is the best at both,1
oh come on stuckmann admit it dane dahaan green goblin is really look like a goblin not william dafoe halloween bullshit,0
uncle ben dying wasn t extremely happy,0
well spiderman homecoming was also happy,0
where did you get your shirt,0

that part when they wore the colors of the heroes and villains i never noticed wow and i loved the story line and emotion to the trilogy more i cant feel the vibe with the new ones and the casting is not my preferred this was an amazing review,0
i m so happy spider man homecoming wasn t disappointing,1
great review very fair review levelheaded without all the cliche garbage people circulate on the internet,0
spider man and spider man are on my top ten favorite superhero movies the dark knight logan spider man superman spider man x batman captain america the winter soldier superman the dark knight rises,0
i admire chris s reviews of the raimi films thanks for addressing the quips as well tobey had the least quips but imo had the best ones,0
i have a massive crush on this girl too so i get it,0
chris you re not seeing what is obvious with the mechanical web shooters ditko invented a logic for the transformation peter simulates a spider s abilities in whatever organ that is analogous to that of a spider s no organ analogous to web shooters such is parker s luck also the mechanical web shooters show off peter s genius and provides a weakness ditko was way smarter than you or most people and that includes me as well,0

willem dafoe really wanted to use prosthetics so that the goblin mask would be emotive like in the comic books and that was the original design there s a bts costume fitting video up here somewhere but was unfortunately allergic to the materials thus the power ranger mask was born,0
gosh i don t get why nostalgia critic hates the raimi spider man movies as much as he does they are clearly better than the amazing spider man,0
toby has ruined every film he has ever appeared in i can t stand him and i am not one to hate,0
so power rangers were the ripoffs from green goblin xd,0
spiderman is imo the best sm and the best superhero movie overall,1
my first introduction to spidey was watching the s show on vhs from our local video rental store funny how back then it was the most mind blowing thing i d ever seen have to confess i used to do the crawling down the stairs in the costume when i was about,0
william and james were really good examples of casting people that could actually look like father and son,1
jk simmons can do no wrong,1
am i the only person who liked spider man more than spider man,0
one of my all time favourites,0
i loved spider man growing up too he was my childhood hero and he has a place in my heart,0
the funny thing is that the web outline of spider man s costume in the movie was originally suppose to be a black outline like the comics unfortunately the cameras couldn t pick up the black due to the fact this film was also made in instead they used silver outline on the web areas of the costume in order for the camera to see it clearly,0
i would have given it an a it is still to this day one of the best spiderman movies of all time,0
i cried when the green goblin got killed,0
tobey maguire best peter parker andrew garfield best spider man tom holland kills it as both,0
goblins suit is a flight suit y all ever see a flight suit it s a big ol onsie yes it s going to look weird,0
also if he can climb walls because of the little spider hairs that grown out of his hands then how does that work when he has gloves on and where does he get the suit in the first place,0
what about the terrible cgi in the scene where peter chases down uncle bens killer and the really bad product placement witht the massive carlsberg beer truck,0
where the fuck did you find a patrick bateman statue,0
great review loved all the background info too this movie started me on the path of being the superhero fanatic that i am today tobey maguire did a fantastic job as spider man,0
hey what did you think of the venom teaser,0
hey chris try watching blade and see if you like it,0
oh chris u are the best reviewer ever no competition,0
the green goblin bomb had gore if you slow down the film you see the red quickly fade where the graphic stuff was cut,0
a is a pretty accurate rating for this movie tbh,0
i still loved james horner s score for tasm than any other spiderman musical scores no hate please,0
god speed spider man peter don t tell harry,0
god willem dafoe s smile is creepy,0
if i ve said it once i ve said it a thousand times you can t beat sam raimi spiderman,0
this is my favorite spiderman movie,0
yess toby mcguire,0
my ranking spider man films from worst to best amazing spider man spider man amazing spider man spider man homecoming spider man into the spider verse spider man,1
this movie still has so much on spider man homecoming the music is great the cast is perfect and it almost feels like it s right out of the comic book,1
really great review one thing i would mention though is unlike in the comics spider man killed his first villain,0
man that venom shirt is badass,0
too bad i wasn t able to watch spider man back in i was still a baby lol,0
just rewatched the movie this is a top superhero movie that doesn t get the credit it deserves action fun emotion spiderman spiderman is my favorite hero and this is one of my favorite movies now,1
spiderman is such a good superhero you d think his life is amazing but his personal problems make his life a disaster but great power comes great responsibility so he has to put his personal problems aside and go be the hero everyone knows and loves,1
you stan lee was originally gonna spider man fly man and the insect,0
watching this exactly year later,0
damn that s a sick shirt chris is wearing,0
i love it how he says about dark and gritty being sad which not every comic book movie can be light and fun its all about balance and personal taste if you like light and fun go ahead and if you like dark and gritty go ahead no one can t tell you to like this or that personally i prefer dark and gritty comic book movies because the best stories and characters come out of darkness and seeing them be challenged is the best part of the dark gritty comic book movies back to spider man i absolutely love this movie i remember it so much i watched over and over again when it came to dvd same as x men it still in my mind is the best spider man movie of all time,1
idk if you noticed but the scene when he passes out in his room after he got bit by the spider before the camera pans up he has a poster and on the bottom it says the adventure begins nothing major but it s just something i noticed,0
i currently have that embarrassing crush on a cute girl at school pretty sure she knows i like her tho,0
i saw this movie when i was years old man you don t know how much i been liking spiderman since when i was a kid,0
just realised spiderman doesn t even know how he got the powers he literally never finds out but if the spider bit him why didn t it bite anybody else and don t they still exist,0
kirsten dunst was fucking gorgeous jesus i wanted to bone her so bad,0
great review chris but i gotta know your opinion on the spectacular spider man cartoon,1
my bus driver did that a lot i got him fired,0
lol,1
jk simons seemed born to be j jamenson was the perfect cast i wish he is recast in the mcu,0
that shirt is sick,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man spider man homecoming,0
man i was when i first watched this film on dvd it was the first marvel film i ever saw and i loved it,0
personally my favorite superhero movie of all time this movie has always had a place in my heart since i was little,0
spiderman,0
homecoming is a kiddiefest should have been called spider boy,0
you are a great movie analyst,0
hey chris have you seen that test footage for the original goblin suit it looks almost exactly like the comic,0
i loved this film because it mixes home life and normal everyday activities with epic action sequences,0
green goblin was such a great villain thing i love is how smart and clever he was he was able to piece together that peter was spider man all by seeing the cut on peter s arm during the dinner scene that he got from his arm blade in the burning building scene he put and together and thus figured out he needed to attack aunt may to hurt spider man i really admire how smart he was in this movie,1
i ve never gotten why people were so pissed about spider man having organic webs in the comics he s had organic webs and web shooters so it really doesn t matter,1
great review,0
it was sony get your script right,0
spider man spider man spider man tas tas shc,0
the way you talked about this movie i thought youd give it an a,0
spiderman spiderman spiderman the amazing spiderman the amazing spiderman spiderman homecoming,1
tobey maguire sassed randy savage and got away with it,0
spider man spider man spider man amsm amsm,0
you look like toby maguire btw,0
i thought that the spectacular spiderman had the perfect amount of quips without making spiderman annoying but otherwise this movie was more or less perfect,1
jim carrey to play spiderman,0
i have the first comic for spider man and many more,0
so you made this a series of reviews leading up to civil war funny cause spiderman didn t do jack or shit in that movie,0
mj was so much hotter in than,0
dayum green goblin going to town on spidey,0
toby was great but he was not the best spiderman in my opinion he didn t have enough comedy and he didn t feel like a high school kid because spiderman is in high school but you do sympathize with him for being a nerd that no one likes,0
all the people complaining about the green goblin outfit have you seen the comic costume he s wearing a purple tunic and an elf hat granted it works in the comics personally i think the hobgoblin looks far better but still but c mon would that work in a movie i think not,1
just saw home coming this movie can t come close to the sam rami first two original spiderman,1
it s good that s my highest rating for things it s basically a b up to an a,0
if shazam has a place in both spider man and then yeah power rangers have a point p,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man,0
what you have of them,0
i will hold this movie as a special film in my heart this came out at a time when i was really getting into the pg culture because i was literally when this came out on top of that i went to universal s islands of adventure which has marvel superhero island i could compare and contrast the spider man ride and the movie after growing up watching the s tv show on fox kids this film really felt like a comic book coming to life if i were to compare the late s s s early s blockbuster era to the s blockbuster the late s s s early s wins because it wasn t oversaturated and was not trying too hard well except the star wars prequels but that s another story haha this film holds up much like how star wars a new hope jurassic park back to the future indiana jones batman superman e t etc hold up spider man and x to me closed the old style blockbuster era because the dark knight films iron man casino royale transformers and avatar would start the new blockbuster era that continued in the s i will miss this time period when spider man came out,0
norman s suit it may look like a power ranger however the mix of sinister given from willem defoe makes the suit scarier than it really should be which is impressive from both raimi and defoe willem pulled it off easily the mouth on the suit ain t exactly as friendly as a power ranger nor are those eyes those horrible yellow eyes the suit doesn t come across as silly by an means in my opinion,1
i actually believe that the colors in the thanksgiving scene are significant and accentuate the movie s theme of conflict through contrasting imo peter directly opposes the green goblin so he wears his colors the green goblin directly opposes so he wears his colors harry is arguably conflicted about which side he is on so he wears both colors and this character arch persists through the entire trilogy,1
the first spiderman movie is awesome my moms cousins worked on the set of spiderman when i was little they gave me a poster that was used at the world premiere they also gave me some bombs from the green goblin they used the real molds that were on the set too make them,0
chris stuckmann the man who got his dick stuck in a tree hole is sitting there right now with a tree log on his lap just out of shot because he like s it,0
spider man fun energetic heartwarming and heartpounding spider man heartbreaking inspirational dramatic action packed grounded and optimistic by the end spider man doesn t evoke any emotion of the first two movies but stands out as cheesy fun with a lotta awful moments the amazing spider man very dull with a bland plotline but i liked the chemistry between garfield and stone and the action scenes the amazing spider man so many things at once peter s backstory subplot peter and gwen gwen going off to oxford harry s dying or something and needs peter s blood electric boogaloo is bitten by some shiny fish and gets powers and now wants revenge on spidey because he forgot his name the sinister six set up destroyed any shining hope of spidey s tarnishing reputation in the movie due to rebooting criticism spider man homecoming fun funny light hearted joyous optimistic heartfelt and gives a glimmer of hope for the future spidey films to expand while retaining the joy and spirit of my favorite hero,1
realistic i ve never seen anyone fighting and grunting like this in real life xd,1
i completely disagree about the web shooters the web shooters are an important part of peter parker s spider man s character as they show how smart he is because he can make these things it proves to the viewer that he s an actual genius and not just a pretty smart kid it also creates a lot of moments of tension when he is out of webbing also it makes more sense why he does the famous spider man hand sign to shoot his webs if he has web shooters this is because he is pressing a button on his palm to activate the webs that are specifically designed to only fire when the exact pressure of his two fingers press the button in the movie no explanation was given as to why this hand signal fired his webs,0
spider man is the first superhero movie i ever saw and loved i saw it after it had come out to dvd i saw it at i do remember the finale i almost couldnt watch it it was so brutal but i was amazed,1
phenomenal movie,1
this movie is brilliant thank you,1
spidey is my all time favorite superhero i remember the summer my mom took me too see it back in i was so excited i still love it i had the biggest crush on tobey mcguire back in the day spider man is still timeless,1
i remember when i first heard this was coming out i was probably the most excited kid in my neighborhood i went around the block and told my neighbors about it so excitedly got a bunch of posters and put them up at my house bought the soundtrack and when i realized i couldn t see it opening day because of how crowded it was at the theater my heart broke and i cried my heart out i swear this is when superhero movies were still few and far between each other and seeing them on the big screen was grand and epic not saying superhero films aren t still grand and epic but you don t get that experience of seeing your favorite superhero on the big screen like you do for the very first time the spider man may have its cheesy moments but it will forever have a place in my heart,1
best spider man review ever,1
my personal opinion spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b waaaay better than people give credit for tasm c tasm d homecoming b,1
i always wondered why bruce campbell was always in the spider man movies for a while i just thought maybe he was a spider man fanboy and for all i know he could be but nah he knows the director awesome,1
chris defends the green goblin suit by saying it s a comic book movie so it has rights to be silly but when he defends the organic web shooters he goes with the it s more realistic argument it s like when he reviewed the lost world he said it unfairly gets compared to the first movie too often and when he reviewed return of the jedi he said it s a disappointing movie when compared to the empire strikes back he always contradicts himself whenever he has a controversial opinion about something,0
the nostalgia when i watched this d i mostly remembered the house on fire scene when he gets scratched,1
too bad fans are declaring this trilogy horrible now,1
i just rewatched spiderman and and this is still my favorite superhero franchise to date,1
where can i get a blu ray original cover of spiderman,1
,1
,1
,1
,1
,1
a logan version of a sequal for this universe of spider man anyone,0
i mean i liked homecoming much more than this movie is it just me i feel i m all alone when i say this isn t that good,1
but why didn t you actually talk about the flaws of the movie all you did was say there was some but you didn t do a full review just sugar coated the bad stuff barely even mentioning them this feels quite one sided,0
the writing of this movie is absolutely horrible,0
in the s series the spider on his chest only has legs,1
you should put deadpool under your spider man review playlist,1
willem defoe plays green goblin now he s ryuk in the upcoming death note netflix film,1
only an a what the hell is wrong with the film it should be an a at least,1
yo this guy looks like tobey lmao,1
an armored suit makes more sense than cloth,1
i agree best casting for a movie easily,1
back to formula,1
spider man is better than spider man,1
ggget to da chopperr,1
there was one major plot hole in this movie which was the fact peter found out that the goblin osborn figured out who he was but peter was shocked when he actually unmasked himself and found out he was osborn,1
i still have the plug and play game for the spiderman movies,1
i used to think that i was spiderman when i put my finger on the page of my textbook and would pull it up slightly,1
in this film there are many dark scenes like the final battle,1
,0
spider man best spiderman movie spiderman iconic movie spiderman was awful and sucked ass the amazing spiderman good movie the amazing spiderman had a lot of problems wasn t bad but wasn t good spiderman homecoming haven t seen it yet,0
this movies casting in general is unreal,0
holland all,1
question where do u get all of your spider man t shirts from as they look really cool and i would love to have some,0
i think the green goblin looks like a power ranger complaint is really funny when put into context since the power rangers might not exist without spider man so the s had two live action spider man shows the american show that was really dumb and the japanese show that was ridiculously awesome from what i ve heard the people who made kamen rider and the other shows power rangers was based off of got some of the influences from this spidey show such as the spider man mech robot and such,1
the movie is a classic,1
i wish more superheroe movies would get a villain hero fight like this one avengers only battle armies no super villain has ever made like a tough fight more than this one and doc ock i mean s besideshcredder from the s haha and bane owned batman sure but the nd fight i just didnt feel it batman just came back and kicked his ass there was not a sense of thrill,1
i waited a long time for this movie and i loved it tobey is my favorite spiderman including tom holland,1
face herpies,1
am i the only one that likes all the spiderman movies heres my list tasm tasm spider man spider man spider man spider man homecoming my list is so different to everyone elses i really liked tasm and sm and dear lord homecoming is a masterpiece easily my favourite movie ever,0
you described the same reasons i love this spider man movie and indeed the finale is so brutal for an action hero movie year old me at that time was sitting there with big eyes o o i read that they had to change some of the blood into spit because it was too bloody for a movie with that rating,1
i love when chris thinks that its more realistic that peter has organic webshooter rather than creating his own because he s poor lol,0
nice review my fave spider man still after watching homecoming,1
the best thing that came out of this movie is the nickleback song man that song kicks ass even years later,1
didn t realize for awhile the sexual innuendo behind the big change line,1
where did u get that shirt tho,1
you can t know for a fact that all bus drivers would never laugh at one of thier passengers i ve been debating posting this for well over a year and now with the new spider man coming out i feel that it is time i love your reviews but this has really bothered me thinking about it everyday and really contemplating the deep meaning of knowing for a fact in fact knowing anything for a fact isnt really possible so it pains me to post this but i have to do it or its gong to drive me crazy keep up the fantastic reviews and videos,1
just saw homecoming great movie but imo it doesn t compare to the first with the greatest spider man ever tobey maguire,1
blade got spider man and x men greenlit,1
shazam,0
you are literally my favorite movie reviewer keep it up man,1
now i really want to see it again,0
honestly speaking i think this film is honestly just good i prefer the amazing spider man over this one actually not that the movie is bad but a few things but me from enjoying this film the effects i m sorry but most of these effects did not age well at all keep in mind films like terminator judgement and jurassic park came out years before this so this film has no excuse a lot of the action is kinda corny i mean the final battle and the one in the burning building are pretty good but every other fight lacks good choreography stakes and intensity its goofy moments i m ok with j k simmons overacting as jameson because the character is essentially a big loud cartoon but the green goblin costume looks pretty silly but there s just so many goofy moments i can t take the greem goblin seriously,0
ranking sm sm sm smhc tasm tasm,1
u miss the original aunt mae,0
that scene in the cafeteria where peter catches mj is wonderful superhero movie magic and of course the wonderful upside down kiss was pure magic damn it stop trashing the green goblin suit what the hell were they supposed to do here,1
they need to do a toby maguire cameo in a movie,1
a fun classic,1
everything you said is exaxtly how it felt for me too great review,1
spiderman homecoming,1
ahhh imagine spider man making a gay joke in,1
and i m a huge spider man fan,1
am i only one who thinks this movie is a lot of cheesy fun,1
love this reveiw but peter made his web shooters in school in the comics with tech that he finds there and chemicals and if spiderman would have organic webs he would spin it out of his ass,1
wait when he was climbing up the wall that was a set on its side damn tobey has some really impressive finger and core strength,1
i think green goblin s power rangeriness is less the suit design and more the movement and camera work at some moments,1
a b it s official chris stuckmann hates this shit bomb see transformers,0
something that seemed silly to me was the way he quickly beat randy savage without even hitting him much at all and even though it s cheesy i had a lot of fun with it and it really has a unique directing and editing style by sam raimi that makes it feel special in a way,0
norman osborn gave me nightmares that laugh tho,0
the green goblin was the only problem i had because you you cast willam fucking,0
best movie scores spider man unbreakable tron legacy,1
this movie will always be very special to me,0
sam raimie s spider man will never be topped,0
you were in dude you are hella young i thought you were something,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man d spider man homecoming a,0
spiderman and are still the best superhero movies ever made i love the dark knight series but i think spiderman captures the perfect balance between fun and realism to the degree that a person with spider abilities can be realistic lol this is what a superhero movie should be a straight up a in my book and spidey is an a,0
spiderman and spiderman are really great movies in the third there was a little bit of crack,0
this is my favorite spider man movie,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man,0
andrew garfield is the best spider man,0
the suit looks really good i might add,0
why am i the only one who hates this movie,0
i think it s true that tobey made some jokes but spider man still felt like peter parker through the mask his motermouth is one of his weapons to egg on his opponents honestly and even though i love spider man and more than anything i still kind of wish i heard tobey trying a motermouth spider man like literally talking like he was having fun,0
i f he had organic web it should come from his butt,0
i could ve sworn chris just released these spider man reviews a couple months ago i can t believe it s been more than a year,0
i had a bus driver who was worse than this driver he only lasted for about years but he would encourage fights sexual harassment drugs and get pulled over for speeding it really does happen,0
spiderman and were great fun action movies but wtf happened in same director but why wasn t it as epic as the first had the best final action scene ever though,0
what s sam ramie doing now,0
face it tiger you just hit the jackpot,0
chris watch the spectacular spiderman to really have the best of spiderman such a fantastic show,0
i loved spider man it was so awesome and i had a crush on kristen dunst,0
i don t think the first spider man is that good actually it seems that its only better than spider man,0
i always like to mention to my friends that everyone bangs on about how fantastic iconic heath ledgers joker was and that is totally fair but i think we also need to give big props to willem defoe as also playing his villain to perfection,0
can u do the ben affleck daredevil,0
i didn t really like any of the other spiderman movies after these first ones,0
the only thing that kinda bothered me was that his webs were organic and that spidey was kinda dark but i still like his portrayal,0
niiiiice shirt chris,0
raimi needs to come back whit tobey and make older spiderman that is part of this trilogy,0
this was a good movie tho,0
i hope homecoming is great,0
this film was so good and can be easily quoted i consider this to be one of the top greatest comic book superhero movies next to the dark knight can you name a comic book superhero movie s that is equal or better,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b tasm b tasm c,1
tobey maguire is no longer the best peter parker imo,0
this definitely is one of my favorite movies,0
u should ve done this for spider man homecoming instead still waiting for you to review the mcu films you haven t yet done the first iron man films and the incredible hulk maybe updated thoughts on thor and captain america the first avenger probably for infinity war,1
love this film best spider man movie there has been,0
i love the t shirt,0
review blade please,0
kirsten dunst looks gorgeous on this movie,1
this isn t the original spider man film,0
looking back now i remember just having a shit ton of merchandise for this film,0
finally some agrees with me that spiderman was awesome,1
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman c tasm c tasm c,1
my wife cannot handle the final fight scene every time we watch the movie,1
the movie was fucking awesome when ben died peter peter closest i have ever been to crying like a baby,0
wow you discovered this movie exactly how i discovered it no internet see the trailer in theater lose your mind,0
that part where those people turn to skeletons used to scare me as a kid,0
i agree spiderman was perfect not too cocky and out of character i hate the new one way too full of himself,0
i don t really care i like all the spider man movies but the amazing spider man and are my favorites,0
just subscribe,0
people saying that tobey is a good peter and andrew garfield is a good sipderman just because you fanboys are afraid to admit andrew garfield sucks,0
lol my fuckin bus driver left me in the dust all the time what are you talking about,0
i loved this movie but i never understood where spiderman s web shot out from,0
cough cough biest,0
just the way the old spider man movies were shot is what i love the most about them you don t always have to save a plane or save a boat just a fight in a building that was set on fire was super epic i feel like the new movie is just going to be trying to over do everything,0
i thought the sam raimi spider man movies were boring actually,0
yep that s what a movie review should be subcribed,1
finally for some reason all my friends hate the first spiderman movies i thought i was the only one who preferred sam s trilogy over the amazing spiderman crap,1
i m sorry but i just do not like the mary jane in this movie everything else was awesome but the romance was unrealistic on her part there was also a lot of her actual dialog that felt to forced say what you want about the amazing spider man but they had the best romance yet and gwen was actually a likable character mary jane was every love interest at the time in the early s,0
i have spider man on dvd and the amazing spider man on dvd,0
it ain t a stuckmann review if he hasn t grown up with it,0
was re watching this today and i only realised peter picked red and blue as his colours because of may jane s red hair and blue eyes haha,0
recently rewatching this movie i thought to myself how the fuck does peter not become a murderous criminal after he gets his powers almost every one treats him like shit,0
i had a crush on mj in this movie,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b the amazing spiderman b the amazing spiderman c hate me if you want i enjoy this movie,0
for me personally tobey maguire best peter parker so far andrew garfield best spidey to me he had the wit and smart ass qualities spidey has my problem with the raimi trilogy is mary jane i hated kirsten dunst she just has a face that i cannot stand,0
i dont get people s complaints about the green goblin suit in this movie i know that it looks nothing like the comics but i still think its a pretty sick looking suit,0
this guys face is irritating i cant quite figure out why,0
hans zimmer did nail the dark knight score though i have the soundtrack,1
the way you feel when people compare the green goblin to power rangers is the same way i feel when people compare apocalypse to ivan ooze,1
do a hulk review,0
if he gets all the powers of a spider he would be shooting web out of his ass,0
hughmugus did you just sexual assault me chris,0
hey i was born in were marvel movies could just be good and didn t have to set up a string of universes spin offs and sequels,0
watched this movie on toonami back when i was and the movie was awesome ending great and i love the song by nickelback hero that a memorable song for,0
cool shirt,0
awesome review man but you said i was glad it wasn t a kid party movie this movie wasn t made for children it was made for teenagers and above but they threw some stuff in there so children also could see it,0
i ve probably loved this an the second film longer than any other movie and i m now and as i study film more and more yea a lot of the films i used to like i don t any more like the prequels but these two films i probably love even more now,0
this was the first movie i ever watched in the theater,1
fuck you marc webb,1
i actually always loved the green goblin costume from the movie more compared to the more cartoony goblin like costume also this suit provides as far as my knowledge goes a lot more armor than the original suit so in that sense it s better,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b the amazing spiderman d the amazing spiderman f,0
chris your wearing venom colours,0
i d loved the sam rami s spider man movies even the rd movie,1
incredible hulk robcop aaa,0
i m so glad you mentioned the final fight scene and how raw it is it always seems to go unmentioned,1
this film isn t all happy when uncle ben died i cried this film is edited so well and so well scored i adore this film,1
the moment you own the same venom shirt xd,0
william should play green goblin again in the tom holland spider man movies they really should try to get him to play green goblin again,0
i think you make a great point about the trend of everyone jumping on the bandwagon of the same complaints against movies with the advent of the internet,0
i like your original intro guitar piece,0
did did he imply that toby maguire was a better peter spidey than andrew garfield,0
why have they not done a spiderman series it would be a massive hit marvel and sony must know this,0
the first time my dad saw the trailer for this and saw the cgi spider man swinging through the city he got so emotional lol he still says that this is his favorite movie,1
toby maguire is the best spiderman there is,1
chris you really get this movie thank you for the review i may need to rewatch it soon,0
i watched this movie on my th birthday that s why this film is especially special for me and my beginning puberty life still one of my favourite superhero movies,0
don t mind me just wanna play with my little playbox,1
first video i ever watched on your channel thank god for this video thank god for your channel thank god for you chris you have inspired me for a year now god bless you chris,1
review the lost series,0
hugh wot,0
why is ant man reviewing spider man on youtube,1
so you don t have numbered and reserved seats it s like the only thing you can get here it is allways a reserved seat for you no need to find a spot or something ofc if there is not full no one cares if you switch seat but still they are reserved,0
please do blade review it s actually still my favourite marvel movies of all time,0
haha says good things about everything for minutes then a,0
this is a old movie why would you do it know,1
i freaking love this film along with the second and third shut the fuck up my opinion not yours they were childhood favourites of mine and i still get a huge kicking out of them even till this day,1
that was a great sound track,1
at least it was an original piece of work not the tired old same materials that passes for summer blockbusters these days,1
i loved meryl streep as aunt may,0
that was a good movie,0
honestly spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b tasm c tasm d cap america a tom tobey andrew,1
i did not like toby mcguire he was too much of a sissy emo there is dorky and there is emotionally unstable and in need of a safe space garfield really nailed the persona of peter parker that i read from the comics he is exhausted because he is living two lives and is lacking sleep moral dilemmas are things that spiderman deals with not things that paralyze him from acting also the reason that organic web shooters are a problem is that spider man is supposed to be smart like approaching genius level accomplishments hence he is able to make web shooters with college chemistry items and things he can get at the hardware store where in this entire trilogy does peter parker demonstrate that he is as smart as he is in the comics,1
by saying you like the organic webs it shows your not a comic reader which is fine but it shows you don t understand spiderman and peter parkers character the web shooters are there to show peters intellect and genius yeah he has no money that s the point peter is smart,0
i just saw spiderman homecoming trailer and i realize how much i love this movie i have a special conection with this movie yes he makessss jokes in his action scenessss why people say spidey needs to be a clown,1
gosh why does chris and a lot of critics hate the shared universe concept it is a cool concept,0
plot twist what if that whole dinner scene when they were wearing each others colors just so happened to be a big coincidence lol,1
i always thought it wouldn t align with the way maguire played the really shy cute and nerdy peter parker to suddenly be super whity and confident as spiderman would the mask and persona give him that confidence beating the bad guys and being a hero dunno,0
spider man b spider man a spider man d the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man b the truth,0
spider man spider man spider man amazing spider man amazing spider man,0
it s cheesy and power rangery so articulate do you follow up this statement with substance or example nope,1
where can i buy that shirt,0
why does everyone hate on the amazing spiderman movies i thought those two were better than both spiderman and spiderman,0
chris what did you think of spider man the new animated series with neil patrick harris,0
here are my reviews for the spider man movies spider man d spider man f spider man f the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man b,0
sam raimi spiderman a spiderman a spiderman c marc webb the amazing spiderman c the amazing spiderman f need i say more maguire more believable as peter not dull or boring much more exciting too watch him garfield dull boring skater punk arsehole,1
i love all of the spider man films all of them i don t give a fuck what people say,1
spiderman is an a film in my opinion,1
this film was shit,0
to me the very best movie to define a super hero film genre is spiderman very few films of marvel cinematic universe has been able to do that including the civil war or the avenger series these movies are great action flicks but not as much a movie that inspires quite a lot like the first two spiderman films and the dark knight trilogy,0
chris stuckmann also note that this was one of the many films that was affected by the teaser trailer and poster were recalled from theaters because they both depicted one thing the world trade center twin towers,0
kirsten dunst looked so awesome in sm,1
chris stuckman you said that spider man has organic webs because he s too poor to make web shooters but how do you explain his hollywood costume,0
love your venom shirt,1
i actually think that green goblin s suit fits with the version of the character it is a tactical suit made for the military and i get that feel from the suit,0
every live action movie with spider man in it my grades spider man a spider man a spider man b yes i like it the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man c,1
the first time i watched this movie as a little kid i bursted out crying when spiderman was getting the shit beat out of him at the end,0
i also apologize for not specifying macuga and essrig because i do not actually know them personally,0
my god stukmann i have been watching your reviews recently because i have started producing my own comedy skits for the platform and i love comedy and comics and movies you and bree and josh have really helped me realize how things for this platform should be do ne thank you i look forward to joining you in this world,1
i agree with everything you said sir,0
amazing spiderman in a nut shell,0
holy shit i never noticed the dinner scene dress shirt thing and i ve seen this movie countless times,1
humongous what,0
i always die after hearing shazam,1
score,0
hue,0
the amazing spider man the amazing spider man spider man spider man spider man chris please reply i love ur vids i wanna be like u when am oldeb,0
at i saw emo peter and a bit drunk,0
where marvel movies can be good movies well that s entirely true from what i know there was not a whole lot of good marvel movies pre mcu back then bad marvel movies spider man x men the last stand ghost rider daredevil fantastic four the punisher war zone the punisher blade and x men og wolverine electra captain america man thing howard the duck good marvel movies spider man hulk blade the punisher x men,0
when he realized he s ripped he looks down his pants and realized his dick was bigger,0
i love the sma rami ones but andrew garfield is the best spider man he embodied the character better than toby,0
shazam,1
playing the videogames filled the joke void that i never knew existed until you mentioned it haha,0
ive try to crawl too at wall i thought i was the only one doin that,0
if spider man got organic web how can he shoot them out his gloves,1
it s a film made by people,1
i remember that spiderman said didnt your parents tell you not to talk with your mouth full to jjj when he webbed his mouth,0
spiderman spiderman spiderman tasm tasm according to rotten tomatoes my statement is correct,1
i remember being years old and going to see this movie in theatre and my parents being angry because they thought this was a more kid friendly movie lol,0
spider man spider man spider man sue me i love it too amazing spider man haven t seen it in a while though amazing spider man,1
what s funny that back when i was years old i was watching spiderman on dvd and when i watch the ending i didn t even care about the gore at the end anyway i grew up watching spiderman and it s been my childhood forever still this movie is still badass,0
i like old spider man,0
spider man a spider man a spider man b the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man d captain america civil war a i can t wait for homecoming,1
green goblin s suit in spider man did look like it came from power rangers but so did thor s and loki s suit from allmost all their films,0
this one is an a for me but spider man needed an a,1
mary jane was actually really good for the first part of the film but kissing spider man is just,0
one of the best superhero movies ever made and the most memorable i think it holds up well and was well made with alot of heart and respect for the character i had an absolute blast watching this when i first saw it and when watching it more times damn is it still a hell of a fun ride it always puts me in a happy mood and never ever get bored of it this was my childhood which was awesome,0
tobey best spider man and best peter parker andrew stupid spider man and bad peter parker tom same thing as tobey,1
i think i was seven when i watced this movie i used to put gum on each finger and try to crawl on the wall it sounds stupid i know,0
i have a bad big so fucking bad crush on a girl her name is jenna,0
the music and intro at reminds me of the brock landers title sequence in boogie nights haha,0
i love the scene just after he graduates college you can really tell he feels guilty about the death of his uncle,0
yeah i loved this movie too but sm was an absolute masterpiece it s just a shame that after all the amazing work and great care that was taken to make the two movies great was damaged by sm thanks avi arad lol,0
tobey maguire best peter parker andrew garfield best spider man tom holland best peter parker and spider man,1
wait its a i think the movie deserves better,0
in the back round i see the movie,0
what about the spider man film,1
i m so glad he crawled on the stairs too because i thought i was the only one that did that,0
i like the organic web shooters too in a way but i took it as showing peters resourcefulness that he scavenges what he can t afford to build em because he was clever and knew where to look this probably teams with his spider sense and helps him be such a survivor regarding fighting style finding opportunity,0
i can remember not being allowed to watch this movie i was like and the age rating here in the uk was i was so pissed they wouldn t let me in even with an adult present managed to watch it the week later as my dad got his hands on a pirated copy lol,1
seen this last night and hands down this is way better than andrew garfield s one,1
if you ve ever had a crush on everybody heh so you mean if any of us were ever teenagers,0
it has by far less cgi then any spider man film someone is really in the suit doing most the stunts is one of the main things i like about it and i really like that hero song and i don t even like rock music,0
spider man i really love it gives me so much nostalgia every time i rewatch it spider man i f cking adore spider man almost everything about this movie is fantastic spider man i actually like it yeah i said it i like spider man i guess it is a guilty pleasure of mine the amazing spider man i think it s okay not amazing not horrible either for was it is it is a decent film the amazing spider man i d rather watch batman and robin than this okay that may be a little over blowing it a bit but still i hate this movie,1
who would name their kid flash,0
just when you said because if there s so much of the quips that you start becoming an asshole it suddenly brought me back to the amazing spider man movies and i now i understood why i didn t really like that spider man,0
best thing about the og trilogy was that rami used cg when he had to otherwise he would use real people like the fight between spider man and goblin i hope that the new trilogy uses real people too,0
this review makes me want to rewatch the movie thanks for the review,1
i saw spider man in theaters when i was years old it really blew my mind twice it was my star wars,0
chris u should review the rocky franchise and the shrek series,1
i want that venom shirt,0
spider man spider man spider man the amazing spider man the amazing spider man,1
those s cartoons are still really awesome though i own every single episode on disc and they are sooo fun to binge watch,0
bus drivers never do that well chris mybe in the usa dont do that but sometime you really need to come eastern europe and see the differance d,0
oh no flashback,0
as a kid i would always cry over uncle ben s death d,1
i enjoyed this video and the movie but i m going to have to disagree with you about the web shooters peter parker is supposed to be a lot smarter than the average nerd i like the organic webs but i prefer his invented web shooters it shows off how smart he actually is,0
good review it is still one of my favorite comic book based movies and holds up very well being a fan of the spider man comic books i loved how rami done justice to the character of peter parker great casting choices all around the one major gripe for me is still the green goblin costume i just wish they had went a different direction with it still the rest of the movie is so good that i tend to overlook that aspect,0
the comments are full of tasm movie haters lol,0
you know there was a lot scarier goblin costume at first but they thought kids couldn t handle it,0
i m gonna get fired later,0
just saw civil war and tobey is still my favorite spider man ftw,1
your argument for the organic web shooters has been mine for years if he gets bit by a radioactive spider why wouldn t he be able to shoot his own web it makes total sense if not he only really has spider sense increases strength and the body change it s not too spidery lol,1
i remember seeing the final fight for the first time and i hated that fight scene did it look real yes but that is the problem it didn t feel like spider man was fighting it looked like a regular person was dressed up as spider man in a boxing match,0
i m glad to know im not the only one who crawled down the stairs face first,0
yes very power rangers tight down to a grown man attending high school,0
spiderman is the best spiderman movie and spiderman is the best superhero movie,1
watching this i definitely fell in love with the first two movies again thanks a lot,0
thanks for this review chris this was the first superhero movie i have ever seen in my life and i loved it basically i grew up with this too i really really enjoy tom holland as spider man and think andy garfield is alright which differs from your opinion and i respect it highly but tobey is forever a great spidey to me,0
tom holland in civil war though wow,1
bob is building an army this is bob il copy and paste this all over you tube to bring back the old comment section i want you to join bob s army copy paste this message in order to bring back the old comment section bob is building an army this helicopter with bob is trying to bring back the old comment section copy and paste it over youtube to bring back the old comment section,1
look in the background on the left you see spider man on dvd,0
the best scene in spiderman is the swinging scene,0
tom tobey andrew,0
oh my god the score it it s so great,1
is it just my sleep deprived brain or does get stuckmannised sound like a sexual joke,1
am i the only one who thinks green goblins suit looks badass and not like a power ranger,0
green goblin power ranger oh come on guys that suit is badass does it logically work in the reality of what osbourne tech was doing no but versus herpes face tas and the rubber mask some people cannot just deal with it,0
hol up hoooll uuuppppp the green goblins suit was perfect it could not have been anymore perfect hes a goblin a green one what the fuck do you people want it was what else do you expect he was supposed to look like a green goblin and he did jeeze the point on his head and the fantastic armor just made him being a villain more believeable,0
best spider man origin movie ever made,0
spoiler alert uncle ben dies,0
i loved the fact he had organic webs so much cooler than web shooters lol,1
just my opinion but i think that the original spiderman trilogy is one of the best series of superhero movies ever made and i m talking top,1
i have so many great memories of this movie,0
so i just rewatched this movie just a couple of days ago and i couldn t believe how much harry osbourne gets shit on by everyone mary jane dislikes him for literally no reason norman treats him like garbage and it seems like every single scene he s in somehow ends with him being put down somehow the biggest example is when harry and his dad are arguing about mj in the hallway norman tells harry that mj is just some skank going after his money and harry responds by saying she not like that harry walks back into the room and mj is all pissed at him and sarcastically says thanks for standing up for me like he didn t reject any of what his dad said he did stand up for you in the hallway you dumb bitch they shit on him more throughout the series but the first was almost absurdly hard on him,0
i m not sure if this is true or not but i heard that the scene where peter parker caught all the food on the tray was real,0
best thing marvel could possibly do right now just forget the entire mcu let movies actually focus on movies if you get me,0
you now what i always think that willem dafoe could be cast as an older joker well it suits the batman timeline now which is also older,0
here s your change,0
one of my favorite reviews of yours chris,0
do you mean the dark age,0
i can totally relate to this review so many people love the new amazing spiderman i hated it screw the comics overly dorky cheesy and funny suck the original spiderman has heart and character while the new one has shitty jokes,0
do the mask please and i recommend reading the first comics i heard the first are good,0
as someone who also has had his fair share of crushes i too can confirm that the movie nailed it great review makes me want to pop in the old spider man dvd it d be nice to look back at a fun light hearted superhero movie that s not overly concerned about setting up a sequel,0
i love how aunt may mentions superman lol i forgot he says shazaam,0
i m actually watching spider man on fx also one of the best stuckmann reviews ever,0
this movie is the best,0
mr sunday movies doesn t like how they covered up defoe s actual goblin looking face with a somewhat cheesy helmet and i kinda agree with him,0
i watched this movie so many times on vhs in,0
i liked the first spiderman movie toby will always be peter parker,0
also and this might just be because i was born pre internet but i actually had the green goblin power ranger thought before anybody online told me to,0
you have made me want to go back and rewatch the raimi trilogy,0
this movie is so underrated which sucks this was the first pg movie and the st superhero movie i d ever seen and i m still more than willing to admit that the romantic scenes between peter and mj are painfully cheesy and they share zero chemistry but it s still a fun and atmospheric movie with amazing cinematography and music even though some of the cgi is dated it s still a rewatchable and immersive movie,0
my memories of this movie s premier are crazy it was my first time working in a movie theater and i was hired exactly the day before the premier of this movie it was the worst weekend of my life specially for my feet lol but it didn t deter me from watching this movie and i loved it d,0
for fuck s sake that s really is a fucking trash movie and review i mean come on awful and i mean awful portrayal of peter parker it s like raimi never read a comicbook other than amazing fantasy it s not the s anymore peter parker is not supposed to be that stereotypical nerd with the retarded childish look on his face like he was in raimi s spider man awful mj over the top performance of willem dafoe oh you gotta respect him for doing his own stunts great but what s the point of that when he spent the whole movie in probably the worst supervillain costume of all comic book movies pretty much everyone besides j k simmons were miscasts every fight scene in this film is like a definition of trash,0
the younger generation hates this movie and loves the amazing spiderman so sad,1
spiderman and deadpool are the best superhero movies,0
are you years old,0
i love this movie so much and i think it s one of the best spider man movies of all time,0
i was born in,0
love this movie but some of the editing blunders and such get to me now that i ve seen it so many times kind of surprised you didn t really go into any of it few examples in the scene where he fights flash near the lockers how did everyone know to clear a path for flash to fly past them also if you pay attention to the larger kid in the background after the fight is over you can see him with his mouth wide open shocked by what he saw when it cuts back to him seconds later he s clapping with a smug smile and then he reverts back to having his mouth wide open in shock again in the scene when he uses his web to cross the street for the first time after the up up and away web bit he clearly bounces off the wall only to have the scene cut and we see him comically slide down it seems like the editors should have trimmed the previous clip just a bit more once he tracks down the ben s killer he knocks the gun out of his hand during the fight but seconds later the guy has the gun in his hand again the scene where he is forced to make a choice between saving mj and the cable car makes absolutely no sense to me the only thing keeping that cable car from plummeting into the river is the tension goblin is keeping on the cable once he releases it the line should have gone slack and the only way spiderman could have saved it was to web the car itself or get hold of the end of the line goblin was holding instead somehow the car slips to the end of the cable and latches on and the other end of the cable which should extend the length of the path is now only about ft long and spiderman is able to grab on to that end of it huh i really only have these gripes because i ve seen the movie enough to notice them still one of my favorite superhero movies though despite having noticed these flaws i never did notice the dinner attire that was awesome,0
loved the s series as a kid watching that on usa network in one of the few marvel properties not on dvd somewhere also strange the s animated series is released on dvd in the uk but not here,0
hey man people talked about the goblin power rangers thing at the time i was very disappointed with the goblin mask i thought it was about the only bad choice in the film,0
the thing that captured me with the raimi spideys is that they re just great films and all the compromises it had to do with regards to its adherence to the source material were for service of it being a film first and foremost the camera placements the music the soundtrack even the props just mesh together with oozing artistry imo sad to say i ve recently watched the newer films and it s just feels like a fan made film really no thought can be seen poured into the scenes and even the cohesion of them as a whole were basically non existent,0
imo andrew garfield was the better spiderman toby macguire was the better peter parker having said that the original first two movies are superior to marc webb s version bad writing destroyed those films,0
spiderman is supposed to be a dick to villains tbh like he s a total douche to them i love it,0
chris stuckmann i agree with dude about tobey being the better peter parker spider man great review dude,0
jk simmons was better with his role as fordsey,0
i find myself unable to like this movie because when i saw it as a kid i was shit scared of the green goblin,0
chris stuckmann so your opening comments about when marvel made good movies and ones that didn t have to set up other movies so you don t like the mcu and don t think the marvel movies under the mcu are good,0
i loved spider man then i discovered transformers so i said screw spider man,0
you can see spiderman in the background,0
this video is a rare occurrence of a perfect review,0
chris you always go on about your frustration with marvel and dc doing their universe building you say they sacrifice good movies for universe building but man i ve seen you review and enjoy a hell of a lot of these movies personally i m more than happy to let them doing some universe building and connecting because the idea of a massive connected universe is damn exciting if you want to see the avengers together and the justice league together you gotta accept that movies are gonna need to come before them and that they will need to connect those movies you gotta cut the studios a bit of slack in that department,0
spider men gay porn review,0
you are damn good at impersonation man haha,0
i love the original trilogy and the newest movies with andrew garfield each movie brought its own style to spider man i don t choose one series over the other because in the end both are very good,0
this first line gave me cancer,0
when i was little i loved spiderman so much that once i tried to climb the walls using double sided tape,0
that shazam reference,0
i was in cinema times for this movie this is the most time i ever watched a movie in cinema and i still love the film i watched him for arround times now and it still holds up,0
never really liked the raimi movies they were too raimi y especially the nd one it s like raimi parodying himself he builds the webshooters out of things he doesn t go to an electronic store to buy a bunch of stuff the web fluid was half science geek and half spider intuition the amazing spider man also got it wrong by having him buy it from oscorp,0
i like yr t shirt can u proivide the link for that thnx,0
my bus driver roast kids,0
awesome review i love this film for how dark and violent it is god speed spider man betrayal,0
spider man great spider man great best of the franchise spider man bad the amazing spider man good the amazing spider man bad,0
omg me too,1
good review grew up with spiderman becoming my favorite superhero,0
godspeed spiderman,0
danny elfman did batman and spiderman,0
anyone else see the spiderman dvd in the background,0
the scene where people get vaporized and instantly turn into skeletons always reminded me of mars attacks where the aliens weapons would turn vaporize anyone with one shot it always freaked me out,0
oh my god just realized the actor that plays flash thompson is joe manganiello hahaha wow,0
i have mixed feelings about this i do see your point but personally i feel tobey mcguire s peter was a bit too dorky at times well at least in later movies he was okay in the first i guess but i feel he never really grows out of it like he does in the comic i can t really agree about your opinion on romance but considering i had no romance until i was an adult and the one i had was a bad experience to me i am probably not the right person to judge what a teenage romance should be i do agree with you on the organic web shooter however for the same reasons as well as one more it always bugged me that he never ran out of web in the middle of a jump as for green goblin i think people missed one point unlike power rangers where the bad guys are meant to be real monsters the goblin is meant to be a guy in a suit so it actually makes sense for his suit to be like this,0
good review i guess you don t like mcu then lol,0
i bet spider man will have an a,0
the fight between spidey and green goblin was fucking brutal all bloody and shit nowadays superheroes can t show even one drop of blood unless it s from netflix fucking pussies,0
oh my god thank you the absurdity that peter parker doesn t have natural webs is just shitty i get why they originally wanted him to create his web technologically to show how smart he is but it s a lot more believable if his webs are organic,0
has anyone ever told you you look like paul rudd at least to me you do,0
i saw this movie opening night and i remember very specifically someone making fun of me on friday at school because i wore a spiderman shirt their insult was how the bad guy looked like a power ranger villain so i heard that line before the movie even came out maybe that bully was the one that said it first,0
yea tbh that crush stuff is me rn,0
awesome review chris this movie holds a very very special place for me and i also watched the s and s tv series as well,0
i too was taken back by how brutal that end fight was i remember sitting in the theater and thinking did they change the rating after the last scene while fight was happening one thing that always stands out to me is the hair continuity during the shots of peter testing out his web shots for the first time on the rooftop cut comb hair to side action cut brush down etc etc,0
dude i fucking love your shirt,0
i wonder what the nostalgia critic has to say about this,0
yeah when i saw this movie i did the slow climb up scene,0
spiderman was a mess but i really enjoyed the action,0
the ending to this always gave me chills,1
oh come on the quips were pure ass in the rami movies,0
i just don t get how people like toby better than andrew as parker its a mystery,0
as i remember again back day that movies were just some fun cliche that interesting to watch and loved them that way,0
my favorite movie ever not favorite super hero movie my favorite movie,0
check out spideybrandon,0
the fact that dafoe requested the costume for him alone to wear i believe the pieces used to create the costume were over pieces,1
when are you going to do the review for spider man,1
i rewatched this movie yesterday and chris you are so right i forgot that it was actually good movie since the last time i saw it i was probably,0
ive got that exact explosion effect,0
spider man spider man tasm tasm,1
his comment on blade bullshit blade funded spiderman blade was the kickoff to marvel studios,0
great review chris i love to hear that someone of ur knowledge say that u like spiderman and it makes me sick when i hear bad reviews on these movies knowing that they are the best of all the spiderman movies out here thanks cant wait to hear ur review on,0
the thing abot someone says something to other people and that that thing become a popular fact reminds to the to starwars and those movies aren great but those movies arent that bad as people says but just becuase some people didnt like those movies and that become a thing in the internet now everyone overeact and hate those movies and says that those movies are the worst shit ever,0
the test footage for the green goblin makeup that they never used was really pretty good too bad it never made it on screen,0
chris when i was a kid in the mid nineteen seventies to promote the spiderman television show they had spiderman visit local shopping malls where you could go and have your picture taken with spiderman when i found out my mom was taking me to do this i completely lost my shit i was so excited i love spiderman to this day thanks for reviewing these,0
i agree that the casting was pretty much perfect but honestly mj is a horrible female character just in the movie not the comics,0
can t wait for tom holland s spiderman,0
loved this movie as a kid and no,0
chrisstuckmann you should do a review of the punisher with thomas jane good marvel movie in,0
awesome review i still love this trilogy you pretty much nailed every good and bad thing about this movie,0
that was my problem with the new spiderman with garfield,0
shazam hmm,0
love the begiing,0
that is one badass shirt any idea where i could get it,0
my parents pilled me out of school for an opening day showing of this movie i was so excited i ve always been this way haha great time to be alive oh and no not everything is dark in fact the majority of cbm s have levity stop guilting me for preferring dark cb movies chris i love em they make me moist,0
loved this review,0
with most of the cast being replaced with each time spider man has been rebooted now which is like twice if theres one person i would love to have come back to the series even if probably wont happen it s j k simmons as j jonah jameson i mean he did actualy come back to do the voice for the character in the ultimate spider man cartoon,0
that shirt,0
i remember when i was a kid i would tally up how many times i watched this movie if i remember correctly i counted up to around times and i m sure i ve watched it a lot more times since then,0
the building they shot that fight scene used to be across from i forgot witch highway anyway i used to pass it by in the car as a kid and then one day it was gone for years i wondered why and then i found out after filming the scene in that place they brought it down just a little note,0
gieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk,0
my main problems with this one are the fact that mary jane s character is horribly written like throughout the trilogy i like kirsten dunst as an actress but she was window dressing pretty much the whole time also yes the green goblin suit s design is just too bad for me to focus on the scenery chewing performance of dafoe just looks like bad cosplay to me other than that though this was a really fun time at the movies,0
awesome review chris i may actually watch this film again because of the things you mentioned however i do wanna challenge you on one thing i think that dane dehaans green goblin was better because his look actually made sense in the context of the story which was genetic experiments from oscorp which failed and ultimately messed people up whereas with willam dafoe s green goblin suit it makes absolutely no sense why a mega corporate company like oscorp has a battle suit with such a ridiculous design comic book movie or not no scientific weapons company would ever create something that stupid looking there s suspending disbelief and then there s just silly but i understand and respect your thoughts and do keep in mind this is coming from me the guy who thinks asm is the best spider man film hahaha,0
hivemind wtf,0
i love this movie,0
the final fight scene is made more brutal cause of how light hearted the rest of the movie is really works,0
i agree with most you said anyway i always hated that superhero movies didn t share the same universe this thing bothered me until when the whole mcu started with iron man i love the whole concept is more like the comics and spider man is my favourite one so i m so waiting for captain america civil war to see my beloved spider man where he should be interacting with others superheroes and setting the character for his first mcu solo movie wrote too much great reviews,0
omg i have that same venom shirt,0
my bus driver would definitely leave people behind lol,0
o o i want that venom shirt,0
i m guessing you saw the pre trailer where spider man strings that helicopter between the twin towers,0
i love this version of spiderman,0
a wtf should be a,0
chris you are just so awesome everything you mentioned about seeing this movie for the first time is exactly how i was i would be in the shower doing the wall climb like he does for the first time in the movie and making the music sounds too ha i also liked the organic webshooters and the peter mj relationship as i was also a nervous wreck with girls i ve saved every movie ticket since and that spider man ticket from was a special night for me as a huge spidey fan i m looking forward to seeing how he looks in the mcu keep up the great work,0
mmm sicario case in the lower right,0
i found the second one boring and never liked otto much oh well,0
man i loved your channel,0
flashes realisation that he changed in the tv show is really funny,0
how the fuck does shooting web out of hands can be more realistic cmon now,0
i didn t notice harry but i did notice the other two were wearing each other s colours,0
this movie made my childhood,0
chris you should totally do a review of the x files revival,0
yay one of my favorite movies i was a young kid when i first saw it but i still love it i m glad you take a deep look at movies chris thanks for enriching my life by helping me think about film,0
wow you make very good reviews subscribe,0
still one of the best marvel movies made i love sam raimi he did a great job on this film great cast and everything yeah it s true i remember the theater was extremely packed not one open sit great experience growing up great review chris,0
i watched the trilogy over times lol my neighbors even bought me the trilogy for my birthday because i loved it so much hahah,0
chris you do kow how gay thhus shit is right,0
great work chris you and jeremy are by far the best movie reviewers in my opinion,0
fun fact spiderman actually inspired the power rangers or at least supaidaman did,0
amazing spider man was so sad when gwen stacy died,0
he says big change after he looks down into his pants xd,0
chris question why are you reviewing the spiderman movies if you re leading up to civil war,0
lol shazam his secretly shazam,0
i hate this trilogy,0
this movie is a for me,0
i still sometimes go up to brick walls and pretend i m crawling up the wall like tobey maguire does,0
my dad used to just put on the menu screen and every time spider man swung by in the menu i started yelling and saying look spider man,0
no chris you re the best thank you,0
i did the stairs thing i also religuously watched the s series i remember like when i first saw spider man i couldn t believe my eyes it was one of those moments where i d never seen that kind of thing before someone swinging through the air my brain blew up and the train fight in the second one i didn t know action could get that amazing,0
i liked the movie i agree with percent of what you said but i disagree with toby being spiderman i thought he pulled off the whole idea of the nerdy kid decently not great but decent enough where i didnt like him was and the dialogue didnt help with this all the whiny emo like boohoo bs it seemed like half of what he said was in a crying boohoo tone that annoyed the hell out of me but i will say one thing good at least he wasnt no twilight clueless actor that got the role simply because they thought he would attract the year old girls hack cough andrew hack garfield cough excuse me,0
dude for real green goblin kicking the shit out of spiderman was the realest super hero movie fight imo,0
spider man my favorite film,0
damn i don t have anything i can disagree with you here right on,0
i was raised on this film i love tobey as peter definitely one of my top favourite films,0
can spider man come out to play,0
yes thank you chris so many people dismiss sam raimi s spiderman trilogy as being too campy okay the third one was pretty bad but honestly it s my favourite adaptation of spiderman i did not care for the reboots at all and the first two are so incredibly close to my childhood i ll always love this movie no matter how much time goes by great review,0
people who say that peter is not a realistic nerdy teenager are usually year old dudes who haven t been to a high school in ages personally i was exactly like peter in school,0
so when is the spider man review,0
when will your spider man review be out cause this one was very very well done,0
after also rewatching it recently spiderman was my favourite film as a kid i was suprised how good it still is it s not in my top superhero films or anything though i was suprised that they refenced superman up up and away you are not superman and shazam captain marvel shazam,0
now this is just based on the spiderman comics i ve read but i prefer garfield to tobey he was quippy as spider man and i ve never seen peter as a nerd looking guy i ve only seen him like how clark kent was years ago a good looking guy who everybody else though wasn t attractive for some reason and though they looked like a geek just because they had glasses,0
what you said about how your teen crush i am in that situation now,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman c tasm c tasm d,0
tobey maguire is the best s adaptation of peter parker andrew garfield is the best s s adaptation of peter parker,1
cool shirt xd,0
couldn t agree more i disliked the latest two iterations toby portrays the roll much better oh and toby s suit much better looking,0
rip uncle ben,0
have you ever seen a recent marvel movie very few of them want to be dark and gritty guardians of the galaxy ant man age of ultron first class dude,0
gonna lose a lot of respect for this dude if he trashes sm and prefers tasm over it fingers crossed i guess,0
i forgot how much i love jk simmons in this movie i also forgot how much i love jk simmons,0
i still don t think that spiderman has had the right film treatment personally none of the movies hit home for me,1
did you ever check out the spectacular spider man series that was for me the best depiction of spider man and peter parker in all his nerdy glory i would like to see you review it,1
this is why i love reviews sometimes you get a completely different perspective on a film you think you know all too well i grew up with this one i was and i always considered it extremely dark it was one of the first live action films i rewatched time and time again and really got to live with when i wasn t playing the game adaptation on the gamecube the norman osborn scenes especially the final one with the fight was just horrifyingly dark and raw after all my years of cartoons and cereal in front of the tv,0
i m not a huge fan of tobey mcguire but in my book he is and always will be spiderman,0
so ah where s that spider man review chris i mean we all know you re gonna say it s great but i still want to see it,1
i was never into power rangers and this is the first time i heard green goblin looked like a power ranger so i never noticed that and i have no complaints about that goblin and yes its much better than the stupid new goblin in the amazing spiderman,0
you really are right some of the best casting ever,0
before i had the internet i had entertainment weekly magazine for movie news i rarley ever got to check out that magazine but when i did man i love ew magazine,0
chris is my spirit animal,0
honestly i d downgrade it to a b while it had a more positive feel to it it lacked spider man s banter and that s a big part of who peter parker is as spider man in the comics and pretty much every incarnation he jokes to hide the fact he s scared sometimes and he jokes to throw off the villains otherwise it was a good movie for back in the day but i prefer the amazing spider man movies owo,0
i m so glad he loved this movie it s one of my childhood favorites it s the only good spider man movie ever made,0
go go spider rangers,0
actually the grenade that turns people into skeletons could be a minature dirty bomb you know dense x rays burning flesh but not bones,1
i think spider man was great,0
love the little passive aggresive shots at amazing spiderman well i didnt hate amazing spiderman but yeah the og is the og,0
my absolute favorite superhero movie i do not like the sequels,0
i agree that toby was a better peter but i think andrew was a much better spidey,0
you should do mcu movies,0
i had no idea you were younger than me,0
chris please review filth it s a great movie it s a shame you didn t spend a word on it,0
that explains why it lurks in every british charity shop,0
please review mighty morphin power rangers the movie,0
they need to bring out spidey since its done,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man d,1
this film is miles better than the two crappy new ones,0
whens the next one,0
the memories man lol,0
can t wait for spider man s review it s actually my favorite superhero movie to date i remember getting out of the theater like stuckmannized it was one hell of a ride for a kid back there,1
spiderman is easily my favorite superhero,0
spider man was so good can t wait until you review it,0
god speed stuckmann,0
shirt where you get,0
i can not wait to hear your thoughts on the amazing spiderman,0
honestly amazing spiderman were just plain boring and bad the sam raimi trilogy is fantastic i even thought the rd one was ok that movie at least was more fun than the boring mess asm the marc webb movies seem like they re trying to be more grounded and realistic than the old trilogy yet they have a giant talking lizard man a guy being electrocuted turns blue and gets electric powers and a dane dehaan getting green face herpes this just makes them feel absurd the old movies work so well cuz they were trying to be fun and like a comic book,0
i really love your videos and i always appreciate your critiques keep it up,0
love these more chilled reviews,0
this film is honestly decent at best,0
i remember that when i was a kid i questioned that as well,1
my top best super hero movies batman begins spider man x men the avengers captain america winter soldier,0
he really is the best spiderman tobby,0
he really is the best spiderman tobby,0
my favorite part of this movie was when goblin calls peter and says can spiderman come out to play and the music during that scene it turned into a horror movie lol,0
where did he get that shirt,0
spiderman and sam raimi are great chris nolan was the one who started the whole dark and gritty stuff,1
spider man and spider man were the peak of the spider man movies everything that came after just sucked i hope the new one does the character some justice,0
man you always somehow change my opinion of movies i love how you re able to make me look at the movie from another angle never thought much of spider man until now,0
i m thrilled that i m not the only one who liked tobey maguire as spider man thank you chris for making my day,0
chris can you please review the hulk,0
could you review the godfather,0
the characters are much more relatable and real in the amazing movies in my opinion andrew garfield and emma stone are just fantastic a lot of people have a problem with andrew as peter because he s too cool spider man is supposed to be a nerd well i can tell you the nerd of the s does not exist mark webb tried to to a modern version of the nerd more of an outsider i was when i watched tasm and it was so fucking relatable every scene with peter and gwen are so real to me they are also supposed to be like right maybe i was just lucky but in my school no one acts like they do in the the original spider man bullies who beat people up really like i said maybe it s just my school but we were way more mature flash in sm acts like a year old the amazing spider man is one of my favourite movies just because of the relatability and the performances i realize that it s not the best movie in the series from a critical standpoint but it definitely has a special place for me i think we all have a different point of view of what spider man is supposed to be i read ultimate spider man growing up for example not and thus we prefer different versions of the character i just feel like people shouldn t dismiss andrew garfield as spider man just because the films were lacking in other areas,1
i haven t watched spider man in a while but all i can remember is being bored shitless at the scenes of them just talking way too much about what was right and wrong and how they would have to find strength to power through it and how when they had that power they would have to use it for good becaus but i guess i might have been too young to feel what a spider man fan would feel at those moments p,0
spider man spider man spider man tasm tasm,1
what is in camera,0
whoever thought of the colors in the dinner scene must be really happy you pointed out his job,0
civil war hype train choochoo choooo,1
i feel like chris hasn t really read any spider man comics peter parker s character isn t just a nerd which seems to be a common misconception to casual fans once peter becomes spider man in the comics the real him starts to surface a cool likable funny easy going person that was always pushed around due to his lack of confidence peter gains confidence through spider man there s growth in his character even flash thompson someone who would bully peter befriends him after he starts to stand up for himself tobey s portrayal had no real growth throughout the three movies he remained the same nerdy loser peter throughout the series tobey s spider man barely made any quips like he does in the comics as much as enjoyed tobey s portrayal when i was younger it is far from being a perfect peter parker and not as accurate as andrew garfield s take hopefully tom holland nails it and finally gives us a true peter spider man we ve been waiting for,1
raimi didn t truly understand the characters he was putting on screen although i loved tobey maguire s take his peter parker doesn t capture the personality from the comics webb s characters were much closer to that of the comics its a shame webb s movies didn t work as a whole,0
great review chris your perspective is always refreshing,0
i think the same toby maguire is the best spider man man he should have been back for captain america civil war instead we are getting a kid spider man,0
i don t know much about norman osborn green goblin in the spiderman comics but did he have a mr jekyll and dr hyde personality in the comics as well i ve only ever seen the spiderman films and cartoons,0
you had the same spider man child hood as me and im twenty i even watched the s double episode film thingy on vhs loved it and when you featured the opening sound track from it it took me back,0
this movie is meh,0
gotta be honest this movie does not hold up for me batman still does but this doesn t the cheesiness and action is just cringe worthy,0
test,0
concerning the power rangers suit i ve been saying that since the day i first saw the movie when i was twelve years old,0
concerning the power rangers suit i ve been saying that since the day i first saw the movie when i was twelve years old similarly pretend you don t know what lotr is and watch the very first seconds sauron is on screen inside his mountain,0
concerning the power rangers suit i ve been saying that since the day i first saw the movie when i was twelve years old i also said the same thing about the first appearance of sauron in the fellowship of the ring when he s in the mountain holding up the ring after it is forged if you go back and watch that scene while pretending you have no clue what lotr is you should be able to see it too,0

i gotta disagree with you i find mj one of the most uninteresting boring cliche character ever,0
man i haven t seen this is forever i m going to give it another go,0
i remember my entire theatre stood up and gave a applause,1
harry osborne in his trilogy especially is probably my favorite secondary character of all time a beautifully tragic arc with clear motivations of simply wanting the love approval of his father so well made this movie,1
if i crawled face first down the stairs my parents would call an exorcist,1
shit scared the fuck out of me,1
i always thought this was an underrated superhero movies one of my favorites still,0
toby maguire was a terrible spider man,1
the erection of,0
dope shirt,0
a minus i would give it a solid a,0
the thing i dont like with organic webs is that if he has organic webs should nt the webs come out of his ass because thats what spiders do,0
whats going to be the schedule because these reviews interest me,0
can you also review all the star trek films and the series ghostbuster watchmen,0
when i saw firing building schene in sm ah cliche saving from fire schene but goblin break that cliche so bad still nobody can do that awesome like that that fight was awesome i loved spider man cartoons but after spider man i become a marvel fan but raimi hurts me with ruining to venom i t was my top villain with joker god knows when we will see another venom and carnage story in movies,0
it s ker stun not kere stun,0
u know wat i just noticed lmao peter parker says shazam lmao hmmm interesting,0
the first reference regarding the green goblin and power rangers that i can remember was from weird al s ode to a superhero in loved the line then and thought it was funny but maybe it was already an established then i didn t know about it,0
awesome review chris love that you mentioned blade people forget that s the first serious take on a marvel character before the x men spiderman films and made it possible for marvel it was rated r hell the matrix copied some elements in it blade s shades trinity leaping from building to building away from the police is similar to blade doing the same bullet time when blade shoots at frost on the street the leap in the train station with blade quinn that was done again in matrix i would love to see you review the blade films can t wait for your spiderman review tobey will always be spidey to me he had great quips that line to macho man made lmaoing,1
can t wait for the sm review also remember one of the original trailers to this movie where spider man catches a helicopter in a web between the two towers of the world trade center,0
i m looking at this super deep but you should it s a film made by people who tried to flesh it out so why at the start when people complain about the tone do you revert to it s a movie about super powers from a spider that s a fair bit of a contradicition and don t get me wrong i agree that the constant super dark tone is equally as bad but it s not as if it can only be one of the two,0
sure he couldn t make web shooters but how the hell did he make his suit,0
great review,0
aunt may in the originals makes me cringe so much but the action in these movies set the standard for me,0
that poster brought back so many memories i remember seeing that in the theaters,0
you look hilarious in that shirt but your videos are ok,0
the amazing spider man and as well as spider man are absolute trash,0
that s theme song tho rockin,0
that s a cute outfit did your husband give it to you one of the best lines ever haha,0
you sir fuckin nailed this review,0
rip james,0
what no internet in the house i live in a small town in a small country in europe and i can recall whatching the titanic trailer on the internet back in,1
raimi s spider man is still my spiderman i like them all even,0
anyone else pester their parents to buy them those silly string web slingers after watching spider man i did,0
tobey maguire better peter parker andrew garfield better spiderman,1
the girl i like hates me,0
i actually did that running after the school bus thing that you say wouldn t happen and the bus driver saw me and didn t stop she actually told me the next day that it was my own problem if i wasn t on time,0
awesome movie i give it an a,0
i agreed with everything you said this is my favorite spiderman movie and one of my favorite super hero movies along with the original batman movies,0
has anyone noticed that this guy is literally ben wyatt tho,0
there s more of a connection to spider man and power rangers then you know in fact you could say because of spider man there is the power rangers look up the s japanese spider man live action show and yes he has a giant robot,0
yep i much prefer nerdy spiderman over the hot one andrew is nice to look at but i felt like tobey brought more charisma and relatability to it,1
revisiting this also makes me sad that we ll never see the sm that raimi intended to make if he had just done harry as the villain and wasn t pressured to put all these unnecessary characters in it could have been really good,0
i think one of the fundamental things about spider man that i love is this secret victory of the seeming loser peter will go on seeming like a loser even though he has much more important and grandiose things going on in his world,0
the first spiderman movie is one of my favourite movies of all time i first saw it when i was or and i completely fell in love with it i was running around the house pretending to shoot webs i even did the same thing that chris did and crawl up and down the stairs pretending to be spiderman spiderman is still my favourite superhero to date hopefully we get to see him done justice in the upcoming civil war avenger movies,0
scary stuff i i watched this film last year and didn t realise how great it was spot on chris another great vid,0
hey chris i loved your spider man review would you review the spider man animated series from before spider man as it kinda sort of takes off from the first film,0
it wasn t the power ranger thing it was having a willem dafoe and his expressions and covering it up i think they were trying to fix that with dehaan who can also be expressive but people just weren t buying it,0
my opinion of the trilogy differs from that of many others i really liked the first was bored out of my mind during the second and really liked the third for some reason the second was the only one i didn t feel any emotional investment in nor did i enjoy the action scenes or humor i like the actor s portrayal of dr octavius but not of dr octopus the lady who played his wife was good too,0
this was the first movie i ever watched in theatres i was about i guess nostalgia,0
getting and a is like someone telling you that you look good today,0
that shirt tho,0
yes chris i m so happy you re reviewing these,0
for years i always had a thing for redheads but for the life of me i could never figure out why now i know i grew up on spidey and it was mj all along,0
i believe dc lawyers were asleep when he said shazam,0
i have the exact same feelings about this movie i was when i saw it i remember i was so hyped watching the trailers and after when the movie was over i wanted to go back immediately to the theater i loved it at the time basically for your same reasons good memories,0
i really like the second remi spider man the first one is pretty good too but the rd one nah,0
this movie was my childhood,1
aahhhhh year after i was born,0
where did you get that t shirt,0
where can i get that shirt chris,0
even today many super hero movies could not stay away from the theme of great power comes great responsibility such a great theme,0
i prefer the reboot asm and the original trilogy is cringeworthy its really hard to watch now ugh can t stand it i finally got spider man as he is in the comics with that reboot,0
i prefer dane dehaan s goblin he looks more like a goblin with a disease which was the idea plus he wasn t irritatingly overacting like defoe,0
wait a minute he is saying that he likes peter parker having organic webshooters because he is a realistic spiderman i don t understand what does his realistic characterization have to do with his powers would someone please explain this question to me,0
i ll do enjoy the amazing duo but watching this video i remembered why i begun to love spiderman and why this trilogy has an especial place in my memories thanks chris,0
cant fucking believe these fanboy scrubs are putting winter soldier dark knight and fucking days of future past above spiderman darknight is so fucking overated its just fucking dry a dry shit movie with one amazing performance winter solider was like watching a s action movie that delivered the goods great action decent character development for the first min days of future past will get stale as the years go on its really mediocre nothing particularly amazing and i hate how fox made lawrence and jackman the main bastards just because of their star power and didn t give all parties a look in when the storyline was something that affected all character s not just the most famous ones fuck the superhero movies of today spiderman was the last film to be about the superhero and not the action or banter the whole marvel cinematic universe doesn t give a shit about telling the stories of those characters its just pure entertainment e g mark ruffalo the reason he s the best hulk we ve had is because his performance and character has nothing to do with banner fuck marvel the superhero is dead,0
on your comment about the quips the thing is peter is a dick when he s in the costume he does it on purpose to piss off his enemies and to throw them off,0
interesting that you think this is a happy film i actually find it to be a lot darker in tone than any of marvel s movies now,0
you should review the spectacular spider man tv series too,1
and what the heck about macho man randy savage oscar winning performance i liked this review but come on man more macho man oh yeahhhhhhh,0
sup,0
spiderman best spiderman amazing amazing spiderman worst,0
this movie impacted me as a kid this was the first film i ve ever truly truly loved omg so great memories thanks for this review chris you re awesome,0
hilariocity review for the dancing scene in spiderman,0
chris spiders shoot webs out their ass you sure you want realism lol and the image of spider dude swinging from his ass will forever be burned into your minds,0
i love spider man i grew up with him,0
are you planning on doing something similar to this for fantastic beasts and where to find them where you cover the harry potter films monthly,0
well if we re talking about realism as such shouldn t he be shooting web out of his butthole then cuz that s what spiders do and peter parker had super intelligence so making artificial web shooters makes more sense to me,0
how good is spider man my mom who hates action movies and goes to bed at h can sit with me and watch the whole movie without falling asleep spider man is one of those movies which strikes such a perfect balance that it almost breaks out of its genre,0
this is x better than the recent garbage remakes thanks to the remakes i have lost interest in anymore spider man movies,0
dont tell harry,0
chris you made a lot of really good points in this video like the green goblin power ranger thing good job,0
spiderman used to be my shit oh my god from like i was flipping in love with spider man then iron man came out and there wasn t a spider man movie for like years honestly i hated the amazing spider man so much then as came out and i kind of gave up on cinematic spider man civil war don t let me down,0
love the review tobey is the best,0
a come on it should be a,1
awesome t shirt,0
thanks a lot chris really i hoped for this to happen a lot i love you man you re amazing,0
great job chris as a superman the movie superman snob lol that i am as i am a s and s kid i was not looking forward to this a lot but took my eldest son who was very small at the time to see this i loved it and so did he the next two christmas breaks and birthdays were dominated by spiderman costumes masks web shooters school bags and lunch boxes great movie and i think you sum it up perfectly here i didn t realise how many shots were cgi free forgot about that it was a shame toby didnt get to redeem spiderman with a fourth outing,0
am i the only one who likes all the spider man movies,0
suddenly have the urge to rewatch this genuinely one of my favourite films of all time if not at least of my childhood chrisstuckman another job well done sir can t wait for the spiderman reviews aswell,0
i love campy superhero movies that can do cheesy in the right way we need more movies like this i really hate how gritty all these recent movies are trying to be,0
you so need to see the japanese spiderman tv series jaw dropping,0
i m really looking forward to tom holland spiderman but i find a hard time believing that it could be better than this movie,0
where did you get that shirt i need that shirt,0
am i the only one who hates like all of the new superhero movies from marvel at least,0
hey chris thanks for the nice review of spider man for me who grew up in the s and s reading silver age marvel comics sam raimi s spider man trilogy was great and i agree that toby maguire was the best peter parker on film to date the reason is that raimi managed to very nicely capture and bring the feel of the s comics to modern times without being hokey he understood the characters and their relationships and brought them all to the screen beautifully i loved all three movies even spider man which so many people knock people sometimes forget that the faults of spider man are more to do with the studio than with raimi he didn t originally have venom in the movie but added the character due to studio pressure but he made a great movie anyway as far as i m concerned my main complaint is that the studio didn t stick with raimi sure diminishing returns and all that but the argument doesn t work in this case the movie only made slightly less than the nd one domestically coming in at mil and almost mil worldwide which makes it the top grosser of the three and sony dropped him really sony and it s stoopid meddling do not deserve this character anyway chris as always great review,1
i was so damn mad when they made the amazing spider man i ll never watch that dumb ass reboot ever,0
ohhhhhhhhh packers just tied the game to send it to overtime omg,0
damn chris i think you re becoming the most nuanced if not best reviewer online between pointing out the dinner clothes here and kylo rens face changing color in tfa mind blown,0
that shirt i want that shit,0
the peter trying to shoot his web scene is still iconic to this day,1
hi chris i was wondering what you thought about the decision during the marketing for spiderman to delete the world trade center from one of the early trailers as you know this movie came out soon after september th,0
i love the music of the live action tv series too did you know that there s a chilean movie called mirage man about a sort of superhero that got a lot of inspiration from that old tv series actually in the final credits they thank actor nicholas hammond i believe because they took a lot of his moves as spiderman,0
chris is letting nostalgia get in the way of honest criticism here and being too soft on the film s horrible flaws i hate it when fan boys review films,0
oh god this movie to me is the marvel equal of batman forever dunst s acting was flat and made the film seem like she ddn t even want to be there and along with her publicity of saying how much she didn t like the film blah and casting a year old spiderman to be a teen ager suspension of belief was not possible,0
is the audio scratchy for anyone else,0
i watched the amazing spider man before the previous three and i must say i think i prefer andrew garfield over tobey macguire tasm though could have been so much better,0
same thing happened to me and my mom when we first saw it on tv,0
chris stuckmann is one of the few movie game reviewers on all of youtube that doesn t have to be snarky or an ass to do great reviews you are a breath of fresh air sir keep it up you rock,0
huh ur years older than me and also i own all of the original spider man trilogy and agreed tobey maguire is amazing,0
its funny you mentioned the love story and how you related to it i think the sequel romantic angle is more relatable have you ever been close to a girl but yet she seemed so far,0
i can t wait to hear the spider man review its probably the second best super hero movie behind unbreakable fuck it i ll list my top unbreakable spider man x batman begins or dark knight i prefer batman begins more iron man,0
at the time and being a massive marvel fan when spider man came out it was one of the biggest things i had ever witnessed this was the first really well done marvel film ever and it was awesome,0
wow great review thanks,0
this made my day,0
chris did you ever see j k simmons on oz that was pretty much his breakout role i think,0
the sam raimi spiderman films are like old wine it gets better and better with each time viewing and it stands out to the test of time unlike marc webb s god awful version sam raimi marc webb hell marc webb,1
i surrender,0
i m really interested on his updated view on the amazing spidey,0
to me it looked like green goblin was naked they shouldn t have modified his clothes exact same complaint about mystique,0
chris please,0
thanks stuckman now i really want to watch this movie again,0
chris chris listen theres a new clover field trailer called cloverfield lane please review it please chris it looks amazing im going to die,0
slander is spoken on print it s libel that s the funniest line in the film hands down,0
love these analyzed videos especially on the older movies so much nostalgia for me and my experiences with spiderman are similar to yours since we are around the same age keep em coming,0
years later and i just now got the shazam reference in the movie and i feel so giddy right now it s crazy,0
parker you re fired,1
totally agree chris,0
i liked the spiderman movies as a kid but didnt appreciate it as much as an adult never has a movie in my opinion captured an actual comic book movie as much as spiderman marvel movies are great but its not a comic book movie but more like a comic book flavored movie i have realized over the years especially the first spiderman movie how great it is because at the time there was nothing to really compare it to,0
i watch the sam raimi spiderman trilogy yes even the third like every year and in the last year or so one of the to networks here in australia plays like all films llike an unusual amount of times but i do feel like if it wasn t for xmen raimi spiderman we wouldn t have all the superhero films we have today,0
spot on the raimi spider man movies get way to much hate these days,0
great now i wanna watch this again,0
nothing is better than the classic well spider man was great but after that nothing comes close even to the movies now,0
love youre vids burn that shirt fuck,0
i know i m the best thank you chris,0
he looks like adam scott,0
great review chris after watching this i really feel like going back and seeing the movie again on the spider man thing and the quips and what not i honestly like tobey maguire as spider man he was fantastic when it came out and ultimately he killed it in the role however his character just lacked progression to me my whole thing with peter parker personally is that he shows some of the best character progression out of any comic book character he s a soft spoken nerd looked down upon by everyone and falls in love with a girl hopelessly out of his league he wants to be more he s insecure and weak and loves science and blah blah he gets super powers and immediately you have given power to a guy who has always been weak has always been picked on and pushed around and now he instantly wants to show the world that he s better he gets cocky he becomes basically an asshole because that s how the world treated him so who cares then his uncle dies and he learns the great power responsibility stuff he s immediately humbled and grows as a person but even though he s doing all these amazing things and fighting all these people and villains it s not like he s automatically fearless he s just a nerd from queens of course he s scared he s scared out of his mind and because he s scared he hides that by making quips he belittles his villains he basically humiliates them because if you re fighting sociopathic humanoid rhinos and psychotic killer goblins and whatnot the first instinct is to make fun of them so they don t seem all that scary that s why the quips are so essential to his character tobey just never got passed the nerd stage and he never grew as a character he was the same andrew is closer to a perfect spiderman to me but ultimately he didn t show that outcast side enough he didn t seem all that weak or whatever so when he got his powers it s not like he changed much he just was himself a lot of people don t seem to recognize much that nerd peter parker is only like at best of spider man s whole character he s like that in the beginning but that quickly fades,0
did you review the christian bale s batman trilogy,0
thanks for helping pass the time for civil war like you did with the force awakens seriously this helps me not to go crazy waiting,0
green goblin being a power ranger is the same as jar jar binks ruining a star wars movie people just regurgitate memes on the internet and eventually it spreads and becomes truth in reality the green goblin costume was not that bad and jar jar binks was not that bad i too am annoyed by internet fads trends memes bandwagoning peer pressure sheep a nerd culture that can never be satisfied by anything rant over,1
back when marvel wasn t all about box office cut and paste popcorn movies,0
anyone who thinks the new spider man is better than the old ones are either a or b really stupid,0
man william dafoe pestering raimi am i the only one imagining raimi getting jump scared by dafoe face s popping up from knowhere and being like please but yeah i do love this one altho my favourite is the second one,0
thank you for defending kirsten dunst s performance the downside to keeping mary jane as the girl peter can t have is that her character wasn t explored very well hence people grumbles about her just being eye candy and one of the things the third movie did right is explore her life more now that both her and peter were a couple plus you have all these other characters to and relationships to explore as well so mj ends up getting pushed into the background but i will never disagree with anyone who says she had too many damsel in distress scenes i have to give kudos to marc webb for casting emma stone as gwen stacy stone s personality is so colorful she could do a romance about being in love with a rock and you d still believe it but pushing aunt may the way he did to the side was unforgivable yea the previous movies established peter and may s relationship but amazing spiderman was a reboot,0
i m so glad you pointed out how amazing sam raimi did directing this film i don t know how he did it i see what s on the screen and i ask myself how did he direct this the swinging the story the characters the acting the camera work cinematography pacing everything i have no major gripes with this film masterpiece of a film,0
spiderman for is the best superhero movie ever made,0
the whole thing with this web shooters i think it s good both ways organic may make more sense but it shows how much of a genius he is if he makes them himself,0
mary jane s nipples,0
i liked this because i was underwhelmed but i knew a lot of what they wanted to do with it also if mocap was a thing back then willem dafoe should ve had that used on him as well,0
my glasses are the same as peter parker s o,0
try working in the tri state area with average kids trust me bus drivers are dicks,0
the reason people didn t like spiderman as much was because of the awkward jazz club dance scene and not enough venom but the action was great and last fight with venom and sandman was memorable and great every action scene in the movie was great the peter montage scene was quite funny people yeh it may be goofie but it was cool for peter to act confident for once,0
agree with you about willem dafoe in this movie my thoughts exactly perfect couldn t imagine anyone else,0
i hope when you talk about spider man you mention the classic video game hey spidey u da man,0
spider man spider man the amazing spider man spider man the amazing spider man,1
still prefer amazing spider man,1
amazing spider man films spider man andrew garfield tobey emma stone kristen dunst,0
cute nerds are the best,0
haha face herpies,0
willam dafoe s costume should have been like the original green goblin s especially the facemask being able to show his face as it were dafoe could really have brought the goblin to terrifying life,0
subscribing cause this review was amazing and i can t wait for the spider man review i hope you love that movie more cause it s the best damn comic book film in existence,0
i can t front kirsten dunst was so fucking hot in this movie say what you want about her now but in this movie she was a fucking goddess like gotdamn great mj,0
it always blows my mind that some american movie theatres do not have assigned seating,1
great review but my favourite spider man review of all time is the sam s channel review,0
i love this movie big part of my childhood but i won t let nostalgia blind me the film isn t perfect it has many flaws but i still look upon it fondly,0
and the second one is still so much better man spider man had so much potential,0
you know what s funny you said power rangers doesn t have a place in spiderman but the japanese power rangers sent an came from the japanese spiderman who had a mega zords and all so yea spiderman made power rangers lol,0
never have and never will care for garfield spiderman he ll the movies weren t even all that great,0
this film taught me what the term rectify certain inequities means so many quotable quotes back to formula avenge me bonesaw is ready i missed the part where that s my problem and that classic matrix ripoff scene man this movie is a classic,0
couldnt agree with you more about tobys spider man movies,0
the score in amazing spiderman is absolutely phenomenal,0
i think raimi s spider man far outweigh webb s spiderman mainly down to the clear storytelling and characters toby get s so much hate but i found his peter parker spiderman far more engaging than garfield s garfield is a fine actor and maybe is more talented overall than maguire but his rendition of spiderman did nothing for me and both tasm tasm pale in comparison from what came before,0
great review chris but i disagree with you on one thing imo andrew garfield is miles better as peter parker than tobey mcguire now i m not saying those amazing spider man movies were better because they re not however the emotion and performance that garfield gives in one scene when gwen dies is better than all the crybaby faces mcguire can muster garfield also better showcased parker s comedic jokester personality from the comics,0
can t wait for the spider man review,0
you really think that elfman s theme is better than james horner s i have to disagree with you there,1
i feel tobey maguire was a great peter parker but not a great spider man you made a point about the quips and how they really shouldn t overshadow anything and they should just be for the laughs but that really isn t very spider man like spider man uses his quips mostly because he was bullied since he was bullied and now he can overpower most people he sort of becomes a bully towards his enemies i just didn t feel that his transformation from the nerdy peter parker to the strong spider man was all that effective since he basically seemed to be the same person aside from his confidence personality wise but despite that it s still my favorite spider man movie maybe spider man it s really close maybe even equal i m not sure and despite most people i actually really liked amazing spider man i thought the peter parker scenes weren t too great aside from when he was with gwen you really got the feeling they were a couple great chemistry a there since andrew garfield doesn t really cut it as a geeky nerd who s bullied but he pulls it off as spider man,0
i watched this movie like a week ago for the first time since i thought it was super cheesy but it was still cool my year nephew loved it,0
grew up loving this character comics hates that spider man is now part of a universe that can do the character justice makes no fucking sense bitches and moans about the only studio that s ever done actual comic accurate comic movies i realized when he says toby mcguire is the perfect peter parker cast that he has no idea what he s talking about,0
raimi trilogy loved it well developed characters story music comic book accurate just great especially for the time amazing spider man great fight scenes suit cg great movie awful characters not well castes or developed couldn t get attached at all just poor,0
basically after this and the spider man films were just meh,0
actually power rangers exit cuz of spider man well technically japanese spider man,0
i liked it,0
i don t know i went to the opening weekend of this movie myself yo at that time and i found it rather lame i wasn t a comic book aficionado but i loved hellboy and thor later and liked the first two x men movies well enough so this shouldn t be the reason for me being less amazed i haven t seen a spiderman film since the music and defoe were good though,0
panda peter,1
ranked from best to worse spider man spider man the amazing spiderman spider man the amazing spiderman almost hated this one,0
it was a nice movie and it was a good start to a fun franchise i only had some nitpicks about the movie that narration it felt a bit silly and wasn t really needed but it s not the worst thing it s purely a minor nitpick during certain parts they have these man on the street style interviews but we never see who they are talking to seriously it felt like a sort of mini subplot that was dropped am i the only one who got bothered by this,0
in less than minutes stuckman has made me appreciate this movie more than i ever have before,0
saw this in the theaters in nd grade still love it to this day as well,0
the first seconds tho isn t that what star wars is doing,0
i was the same age when this movie came out and i also got super excited when i saw the trailer but i saw it on tv and yes i also had a huge crush at the time and related to peter too great review,0
yo where d you get that shirt drop a link,0
i can t wait for the spiderman review,0
ah this is one of my favorite films of all time i remember as a kid i would do the same thing chris would do but instead of stairs it would be the floor and i would pretend i was climbing up walls haha,0
i dont know what it is but the first spiderman and the first xmen have so much more charm than any current marvel movie its like i can resight almost every dialogue from those movies scene had weight they seemed way less how should i say it michael bay esque,0
i had that crush on kirsten dunst,0
matthew mcconaughey could play the goblin ask alicia malone oh no wait she was for him to play carnage but someone in that battle vouched for him to play the goblin,0
lets not forget that this trilogy gave birth to the greatest spider man game of all time spiderman,0
i remember watching this movie while i was in the first grade and for a long time i really wanted to become spider man,0
aw man i used to love this as a kid i can t really watch it anymore though it didn t age well and i find it cheesy now,0
waat ur only years older than me i thought u were like,0
no internet man usa is behind in so many things xd spiderman is still my favorite super hero mainly because of i am brainwashed from the animated cartoon of the s xd i love spiderman and blade were great marvel movies speaking of the music i also like the song from nickleback heroe which was on the ost toby was cast good however i always feel he is too old i mean he was like already and he is supposed to play a teen also i think they should ve let in the scene with the helicopter and the twin towers as a tribute to the towers,0
i thought you were going to hate this movie when i clicked on it,0
honestly i d like a dark and gritty spiderman movie it just feels right yah know,0
review evil dead evil dead and army of darkness,0
the quip argument doesn t hold up because yes he makes an amply amount of jokes throughout the films plus play the movie video games maguire supplies spidey s voice and he quips quite a lot totally agree with your opinion on that point chris,0
glad im not the only one who really dislikes the web shooters,0
a great review i really look forward to see reviews for the other spider man movies despite being a great fan of sam raimi i also really like webb s movies and i find a lot of redeeming features in spider man and amazing spider man,0
tobey was and always will be the original spiderman garfield is a fantastic actor but tobey felt more like an authentic real world peter parker,0
love this movie it is super corny though,0
one of the best superhero movies of all time way better than the amazing spiderman,0
spider man is the best i love the first film but i feel the sequel is superior a solid a in my opinion also i completely agree with chris mini rant on how our views can be formed by social media and the internet in general,0
best spiderman tobey,0
i love the green goblin suit in this movie people are complaining that it looks like a power ranger but would you really prefer a guy with green skin a purple singlet with a tutu thingy and purple elf hat and like you said it s better than green face herpes this suit was really menacing looking and very cool,0
chris i d really like a reply if you re doing this or not mgsv review im pissed at this game,0
loved spiderman two great bad guys the heart attack the heart,0
i like chris vids but he s so scrawny he should lift,0
i really hope very soon isn t a month,0
this movie would ve been a lot better if it was done in the kinetic style of raimi s old films ex darkman i mean if it weren t for the credits i wouldn t have guessed that he directed this flick,1
can you make a dark knight trilogy before batman v superman,0
yeeessssss you finally reviewed it now review spiderman both are great comic book films and are by far my favorite spiderman movies,0
where does he buy those tshirts anyone know any online websites,0
who the fuck liked the organic webbing the reason he had mechanical web shooters was to demonstrate his genius without them the film did very little to convince us of that,0
wow you made me realize how much better this film is than i thought its been years since ive seen it and as it goes you kinda forget just how classic this movie is great review,0
what s a negative can someone please let me know,0
sam raimi is god,0
it seems that with the arrival of social media corporate interference with artistic expression has been amplified from their fear of massive social backlash but really when you look at it movies did much better when corporations took a step back and just let the artists do their thing if you look at spider man before social media and than after my theory speaks for itself the amazing spider man franchise tried too hard to set up their next movie other than focusing on the project at hand this was mainly due to corporations on the artists back as they watched public opinion fluctuate on social media,0
am i the only one who liked the was dane looked as green goblin yeah he was ugly but the green goblin is supposed to look ugly,0
i love the first original spider man movies so much,0
my friend made these visual comparison specifically for those so called fans of spider man that are talking about raimi not being faithful to the material,0
good work mr stuckman too many hipsters talk a lot of crap about this movie while trying to make the andrew garfield films sound wonderful the thing this movie got right was the slightly cheesy kinda quirky yet occasionally sad but always fun tone of spider man,0
i d love to see you review a comedy lol,0
face herpes,0
to me the first set of spiderman films were lee and ditko and the asm films were more like lee and jrs,0
the first spider man was indeed a really fun and happy kind of film but the ending fight with peter and the green goblin is one of the more violent and dark scenes in a pg superhero movie,0
i disagree with the organic web shooters like how does he store all that web in his body and its gross it also creates no tension like he when he runs out from really high in the air,0
this movie to me doesn t hold up at all spider man in raimi s franchise wasn t a scientific genius like in the comics he doesn t have to build web shooters the spider bite just gives him webs he doesn t have to use science to defeat his enemies he just backflips and they accidentally kill themselves in this movie everything peter accomplishes is through the use of spider powers nothing came from him he s not special in any way anyone could have been spider man that spider could have bit literally any other kid in his class and the movie would have been exactly the same,1
while everyone says that spider man is the best cbm and i ll agree with that i still think the first raimi spidey film is my all time favoriote and holds up well in terms of childhood,1
nice review and excellent retrospective of the first film it still holds up i agree,0
christ,0
great review you hit so many points right on my friends always make fun of me for saying spiderman is my fav movie but now i feel better about it,0
what do you think would happen if uncle ben didn t die,0
i ve come to the conclusion that every single venom t shirt is freaking amazing,0
such a cool shirt,0
i love this movie i have probably watched it over times over the years and could easily still watch it,0
very obvious that chris sidestepped the awful cgi in this movie,1
spider man where peter parker struggles with his powers breaks ups with mary jane and battles a villain who kills himself and spider man where peter parker struggles with his powers breaks up with mary jane and battles a villain who kills himself and spider man where peter parker struggles with his powers breaks ups with mary jane and battles a super villian who kills himself wait they made the same movie three times in a row,1
finally you did this i can die in peace now lol,0
i thought you were doing the bourne movies next,0
i didn t like the raimi trilogy at all tobey was decent as parker but not great as spidey kirsten dunst was just horrible jk simmons was perfect though,0
also i just thought you would like to know that i seem to have formed a habit of saying and get stuckmanized along with you at the end of your videos,0
i would absolutely love to see a video of your top casting choices,0
the orginal films are simply amazing asm have nothing on them asm isin t that bad but asm is complete and utter shit,0
anyone else wanna find this on bluray now lol,0
willem dafoe was definitely spot on for norman osborn that scene in the mirror where he s talking to himself is so good also they should bring back j k simmons for jj in the new spiderman movie i mean why not,0
i dont get it i actualy like green goblins costume in this i like this movie,0
review spider man it s one of my favorite movies of all time please,0
the recent two spiderman movies are so bad so lacking,0
damn straight elfman s theme is awesome,1
awesome t shirt,0
please chris i need to know the names of your intro and outro song d,0
the skeletons is a gesture to evil dead,0
good review love watching your stuff man spiderman rating is like d though so it ll be hard to watch that review tons of villains that no one cares about,0
chris you said it man great review love it and completely agree with everything,0
can you do any jodorowsky movie,0
where u get that venom shirt,0
chris why don t you do a richard donner superman review or maybe a hilariocity of superman in honor of bvs this year,0
chris hank you so much you brought across every point i ve had about this movie nostalgia aside this has always been my favorite movie by that being no superhero movie that i ve seen since then even spider man has left such an impression on me kudos on the cgi issue for the budgets movies have now a days it s sucks they cheap out and go for it rather than making awesome special fx and an even bigger thank you on the whole this movie is too cheesy campy most marvel movies now all have some cheese to it as well with the green goblin power ranger suit having grown up as a fan of both as well yeah it resembles something out of pr but when everyone started using it as a bashing overused statement it made me upset because then you have those same people complaining that they didn t give them an actual costume ex lizard leather fetish x men galactus in ff dr doom in fant stick etc to the character yeah the costumes will tend to look silly but that s the point in trying to honor the comic source material and pleasing the fans and with gg they took look at the concept art great inspiration from the classic suit and tried giving it a modern real world aesthetic look remember osbourne was creating weapons suit for the military as for the reboots i seriously doubt anyone can honestly compare those to the original yeah andrew s spider man cracks more jokes and what not but like you said there is a point where it is just overtakes the whole super hero side to it parker was supposed to be a nerd not some cool skateboarder that wore hipster glasses but i will give the point his spiderman is more fun it seems alright my rant is over just wanted to give my thoughts on a review of my favorite movie by one of my favorite youtube people p,0
this movie and the guardians of the galaxy were some of the most fun comic book movies i ve seen everything was cheesy but not cringy the action was outrageous but not stupid,0
my first date i was only she couldn t shut up about james franco i actually barely even remember her all i could think about was the entire movie,0
let me guess the raimi movies are amazing except for the amazing series suck amazing is one of the worst movies ever spider man is one of the best movies ever blah blah blah,1
the fight choreography was really great the goblin and spider man just move immaculately throughout the current shakey cam junkie directors should watch this film for some tips on how to film great action sequences in a clean fashion,0
one of my favorite super hero films,0
i m jealous of his action figure racks,0
my ratings on the spiderman films spiderman spiderman spiderman the amazing spiderman the amazing spiderman yeah i liked that film so what tobey maguire was the better peter parker spiderman looking forward to your review of spiderman that was awesome,0
i prefer tobey maguire s version than andrew garfield s one,0
chris are you ever going to review tangled enchanted kate leopold etc,0
and your video reaction about the oscar nominations,0
willem defoe is the best green goblin ever and i can t think of anyone topping it,0
the opening titles credits of the original spider man movies were awesome,0
hi chris sometime last week i ve got a response to my old comment on your amazing spiderman spoiler review nothing wrong with that ofc but when i clicked the link to your video it wasn t there i mean no errors or improper website loading just a standard youtube site with note that your video is no longer available did you get copyright strike for something i m assuming you didn t delete it since somebody was able to see it and respond to me i ve also searched for other reviews of amazing spiderman movies posted by you and found none only trailer reviews so was it a strike or does this mean you are remaking them in this review series,0
please do darkman i just saw it recently and its still good,1
completely agree with all your thoughts i re enacted that movie and the end fight countless times with my spiderman action figure and my skeletor from han action figure who stood in for green goblin as i didnt have a green goblin action figure,0
great review chris,1
i liked amazing spiderman much more tobey was good peter parker but a terrible spiderman,0
i like andrew garfield the best,0
spiderman was the first movie i ever saw in a theatre then shrek,1
i think it s time for a change to your intro music or is it just me,0
the second one gets all of the praise but the first one is my favorite of them all the first one has a special feel to it that stuck with me to this day to finally see spider man on film it was like a comic book come to life spidery is my favorite hero and it gave me feelings that can t be duplicated like that first high that you can t seem to reach no matter how much you add more and more,0
still waiting for the oscar reactions,1
the only thing the original trilogy did better than the amazing spider man was the costume which every spider man fan absolutely fucking loves and then the amazing spider man came out and stole that advantage,0
oscars,1
chris when r u gonna react to oscar nominations,1
chris when r u gonna react to oscar nominees,1
can you please address alan rickman s passing,0
tobey sucks seems that everybody think he is the best because he was the first but he is nothing like spiderman smart talking witty funny character but always crying depressed goofy cheesy,0

what the fuck,0
you sir made my day thank you very much,0

i also just re watched this with my brother and we agreed it was amazing still holds up even now great movie tobey for the win glad you loved it stuckman,0
i love your venom shirt o where d you get it o d,0
this movie has a special place in my heart because it was the first movie i ever saw at the cinema i d always liked watching movies but more as a way to pass time than an actual passion i also think this movie is what started the supehero revolution lots of people say it was the first x men but even though it was a hit i don t think it was as well crafted as this movie spider man has a great patient introduction and it does two things that a lot of superhero movies forget to do it shows the conflict between hero and their secret identity and it delivers a complicated and engaging villain i loved how the same internal conflict we see in peter is mirrored in norman great acting and writing to create both characters thanks for the video chris looking forward to your views on spider man,1
i find it funny saying you thought spider man was a very happy movie because when i was a kid a actually thought the movie was quite dark and sad at points with a dark emotional undertone around uncle ben dying,0
wow chris thank you so much this is my favorite movie of all time and is what got me into comic book movies in general great review as always,0
yo chris you need to see the japanese spider man show he has a megazord leopardon,0
loved this movie as a kid i even remember the electronic web shooters good times,0

agreed toby is an underrated spider man and yeah the fight choreography in this film is pretty damn good,1
yup i agree with you recently just rewatched the rd one which wasn t that great compared to the first but still tobey mcguire is my spider man,0
i don t think chris gets spiderman if he did he would know why mechanical web shooters are important to the character and what they demonstrate about him,1
what are your thoughts of brooklyn the movie,0
i keep going back to stuckmann s channel and checking to see if he uploaded a vid on the oscar noms yet,0
chris i can so relate to you i still to this day love spider man and has always been my childhood hero you re not alone when you used to pretend to be spider man i used to do it all the time xd lol,0

please please please tell me you did an oscar reaction video please please please,1
please do an oscar reaction,0
chris struckmann i respect you do,0
i love this film,0
im glad we all agree how great spiderman is love every line watched it s times,0
ya i agree tobey as peter awesome jk simmons as jj and rosemary as may is freaking perfect but i do have faith in the new guy he is so genuine and nerdy lol tom holland is great for ultimate spiderman,0
when im bored nd dnt knw what to watch ilook to chris s videos and they get me all hyped to see something imean seriously spider man his reviews are gold,0
well i prefer garfield more as peter parker he is more likeable for me but maybe because i love paul jenkins spectacular spiderman most specially volumes drawn by humberto ramos and amazing reminds me about this peter parker,0
i offered you friendship aannnd u spat in my face,0
i saw this in theaters but wow i didn t realize how old this movie its,0
this review reminds me of the force awakens review poor fanboyism there s nothing wrong with spiderman everything is great spiderman good amazing spiderman bad,1
as a child i found the part where the green goblin dies so scary,0
whenever i see a brick wall in public or any wall i would start from the floor and crawl up it until i reached my top height at the time i was and make say dun dun dun,0
it s funny i actually hated goby s outfit when i saw this for the first time as a kid i was a real stickler for accuracy to the comics back then but now that i ve been watching stuff like kamen rider and super sentai i actually dig the fact that he does kinda look like a tokusatsu villain,0
finally watched the amazing spiderman absolutely shameful rushed plot no character archs no real story no tension builds no time to care about anyone before they die oh and forced awkward twilight style high school acting the original tril completely stomps the reboots,0
why did you quote internet power range green globbin suit with a yms voice at,0
spider man is the best spider man film to date in my opinion is that just me,1
when i saw the first photos of green goblin in wizard magazine i thought the power ranger thing but on screen it totally worked sometimes still photos don t to the movie justice,0
my biggest annoyance with superhero movies is they aren t dark at all the trailers give the impression that that s the case but they ve all been fucking comedy s since nolan finished his trilogy man of steel was just boring fucking ant man what was that shit,0
uh chris you re at least partially wrong on the green goblin power rangers bit while yes people didn t complain as much about stuff like that back then from weird al yankovic had this line in his spoof of billy joel s piano man called ode to a super hero which describes the story of the spider man movie yes he s wearing that dumb power rangers mask but he s scarier without it on,1
i was obsessed with this movie when i was little still love it,0
i loved that movie after i saw it i was so pumped i still love it,0
have you see the s japanese spider man marvel com had the whole show up for a while he pilots a giant cat robot and gets his powers from an alien,0
also i m pretty sure garfield spiderman could beat maguire spiderman in a fight i also think garfield himself could beat maguire in a fight,0
chris you lost me when you called toby the best spiderman i like these films but toby is the worst part next to dunst he is out acted by everyone he shares the screen with when i m more invested in macho man randy savage than spiderman somethings wrong i ve never really liked toby in anything i never thought he ever brought anything special to a role garfield is just more interesting i would like to watch garfield s peter parker just go no a date or hangout with a friend because he s just so good damn interesting his performance is multilayered and nuanced maguire is a baby faced nerd who never fully grows as a person and when he does grow he regresses garfield does this a bit with the gwen relationship but at least it s presented as him struggling with doing what he wants and what his guilt tells him is right which is more complex than maguires relationship with dunst which is he want to be with her now he wants to stay way to protect her now he want to be with her again,1
did chris completely miss the adult humor from the body transformation scene when peter looks down in the mirror and says yup big change that s not just a reference to his muscles i m hinting at his hinting of his newfound dick growth,0
chris ur awesome bro,0
spider man was the best,0
i too thought the organic webs made more sense they did he s gaining the powers of a spider he should be able to produce his own webbing,0
i really like the colors so good,0
sure he should have organic web shooters but why aren t the webs coming out of his ass more spider like,0
honestly i really enjoyed spiderman i was this when i was alot younger and it is just really fun to watch plus they didnt over bloat this movie with cgi like most movies that come out today spiderman is friggin fantastic as well but spiderman it was not the best but it did have some good elements the fact that theres a black suit spiderman was one of the few good elements it had going for it as always great movie review chris stuckmann as well as a nice setup you have there d,0
i love how the comment section is filled with norman osborn quotes,0
i love the first spider man movie i remember going to watch it in the theatre i was years old one of the first movies i ever saw in theatres because we didn t go the movies that often back in the day say what you want about its cheesiness i love it nostalgia blinders and all,0
spiderman films was big when it first came out before the marvel cinematic universe,0
please review my game thanks you so much,0
academy awards reactions,0
i think i m the only guy that prefers the reboots,1
have you seen the animated spectacular spider man tv show it was really good but they cancelled it after seasons,0
plz do a space odyssey review i would literally die if you do who am i kidding he does not care for that movie,0
spiderman spiderman spiderman the amazing spiderman the amazing spiderman,1
this movie still holds up today the amazing one is already dated,0
wow my childhood which makes me very happy and emotional thank you for reviewing this chris from your neighborhood friend spiderman,0
this is the first review to ever do this film justice at all it s about damn time thank you chris,0
this review sounds more and more like i m just saying what people want to hear as it goes on there s something about it that comes off as restrained like if he wants to say something negative really badly but he knows the stigma behind doing this is too broad to do it i also find it ironic he s complaining about the internet but the scene prior he complains about face herpes goblin doing exactly what he complains about,0
spoilers thanks,0
review hot rod with andy samberg,0
i ll make a deal with you chris love your show love your ratings the only thing that bothers me is your language not to insult you or anything but if you use words like heck and crap that s fine h and sh t no thanks if you stop cussing i promise i ll subscribe deal,0
spider man the original now you re talking,0
great review personally loved spider man and re watching it it was really tobey maguire who made me love this movie i wasn t a huge fan with andrew garfield in the spiderman outfit he did give us the joking sarcastic spider man which i loved but he also did that out of the outfit he didn t feel like a nerd or shy or socially awkward he kinda felt like a jerk and him being smart didn t really fit him so my question maybe in the upcoming videos who was your favorite portrayal of spider man tobey or andrew,0
andrew s spiderman is just obnoxious kept making unfunny jokes all the fuking times sometimes i just want him to stfu especially in the first movie,1
i bet chris will give sm an a that s the best spider man movie ever and i think only marvel studios will be capable to deliver a spider man that may be a match to the first two sm movies,0
i grew love grew up with these films and i have to say this is my favorite incarnations by far i honestly wished this version would have joined the mcu this movie had more heart and intensity then all the new mcu films,0
chris where is the oscar nominations reaction vid,0
idk why people just bring down tasm it wasnt that bad of a movie seriously,0
where is your oscar reaction at chris,0
lol face herpes,0
the original spider man trilogy is no masterpiece but the movies sure are a hell of a lot of fun to watch also spider man is my favorite super hero,0
i saw this movie when i was and i remember losing my head after watching it,0
you know how much i sacrificed,0
i still believe there can be a better actor to play spiderman right now i think andrew garfield has played the role much better than toby,0
at one point i thought i preferred tasm to raimi s first two spider man films that is definitely not the case anymore i did grow up loving the first two spider man films but i thought the first one had aged a bit and it has but man did it get so much right and it is still so delightful to watch tobey is my favorite spider man as well and yes i ve read the comics and watched the cartoons but he is just more likeable to me than garfield was before anyway,0
haha i loved green goblin s suit as a kid it was cool never head of the power rangers suit crap imo as a kid i thought it was cooler than the cartoon suit man this was when superhero movies could be fun and a good time without needing to be dark and gritty i took my younger brother to see the amazing spiderman he was the same age as i was at the time i saw the raimi spiderman and was surprised to see how they made that movie gritty like jeeze its a movie about someone who has spider powers don t take yourself so seriously,0
the organic web shooters were still the wrong way to go i believe yeah sure a kid wouldn t have the money or resources to build them but he could make that suit,0
does he not like the new marvel movies,0
chris s mom oh man chris spiderman yeah god job,1
i like his costume in the movie looks better than his traditional comic book outfit,0
oh i m looking forward to your next review i think it s my favorite of the spiderman movies probably just because i loved alfred molina as doc ock,0
frankly i have always thought spider man was a horrible film unbearably cheesy and terribly acted i would watch it again because it s spider man but the film is not well made i rank it barely above the fantastic four people said the third spider man ruined the franchise but i don t think that s true everyone just finally woke up and realized what they were watching was terrible,1
great review i always loved spider man and this was one of my favorite movies as a kid i remember my dad had to convince the guy in the theater to let me watch it because it was pg or something and i was like at the time,0
are you ever gonna talk about the x files coming back,0
lookin really deep into spider man would be a podcast i d subscribe to,0
i almost forgot that fight at the end and how i was shocked i wish the scenes were like that one in the new marvel movies,0
although i love the amazing spider man i agree with you on every point in this review the first spider man movie was what got me into superheroes when i was only years old and i remember watching spider man so much that the dvd actually broke i love how raimi doesn t take it too seriously it s very light hearted and so fun to watch and personally i don t understand the hate that green goblin is getting i love his costume haha,0
this movie is my childhood,0
didn t expect this but always nice to see stuckman review old er movies,0
i feel like i can associate the netflix daredevil series with the raimi spider man movies more thanwith webb s,1
you should review a movie with your mom,0
spider man is supposed to be a dick,0
he got sicario on blu ray that wasn t in his collection vid at least i don t think so,0
will always be the best spiderman movie ever,0
great review chris people trip on spiderman now because the internet sam raimi did a great job with this movie sure the suit was a lil much but willem did norman osborn green goblin justice tobey was good franco and kristen too and j k simmons perfect,0
i d say this film is probably the best superhero origins film stayed faithful enough to source material and ultimately got its point across,1
sickest theme song for any show ever,0
i really love this movie but it kind of hurt comic movies for a while hear me out spider man had a lot of relationship melodrama which was fine because it fit the story the comics have always kind have been super hero soap operas and it added to peter s character that he could mope some times just not too much but then holiwood saw dollar signs so what did we get that same melodrama added to the hulk to daredevil to superman returns hell even the worst parts of batman begins were katy holms being pointlessly annoying for the point of melodrama it s kind of how the dark knight led to movies trying to be dark for no reason when that movie was good because it told a good batman story not just because it was dark i m just glad we ve got over the mopy faze of these movies it worked for the sam raimi trilogy and that s where it should have stayed,0
where is your live oscar nominations reaction,0
a review of memento please,0
spider man when when,0
the amazing spider man movies get a bad rap lighten up people,0
the first spider man from was average but at the same time really enjoyable i really enjoyed your review i am a long time sub of yours chris and wanted to request again still waiting lol for you to do film reviews for the movies hart s war and tears of the sun please and thanks,0
does anyone rember the spiderman game on the first xbox and how it was soo fucking addicting to swing around new york haha i do great game,1
for me tobey was the best peter but andrew was the best spider man,1
please make a reaction to the oscar nominations,0
make more sam rami movies,1
make a video on your oscar predictionsssss,0
perfect review sir,0
tobey was best as peter andrew garfield was best as spider man dane dehaan was best as harry osbourne imo,0
hehe i m going to get fired later,0
chris you know very well that people on the internet don t use questionable ideas and comparisons of other people and present them as their own you just don t want to admit that the goblin costume is a silly power ranger rip off by the way peter parker is a mary sue just sayin stupid nerds,0
oh everything s sad huh huh huh,0
i want to rewatch thes move,0
ewww kristen dunst should never act again dumb they skipped the gwen stacy arch they never showed peter parker use his brain to beat a villian his brain his one of his main weapons other than that i think it s a decent movie tobey was okay as spidey but he was playing the og spidey i disagree on the web shooter thing big time once again that would show how smart he his constructing his own shooters him just conveniently having it is lame and btw those are two different goblins tasm goblin is based on the ultimate spidey verse which he does turn into a legit monster,0
great review chris keep em coming,0
thank you for this review this movie is not getting the recognition it deserves,0
is there anything you weren t a huge fan of while growing up chris haha,0
the difference between these and the new ones is that raimi is actually a really talented director he was the main inspiration for shaun of the dead in my opinion,0
please review the revenant,0
we all know that the amazing spiderman movies were not as amazing as the spiderman movies,1
i remember watching these movies with my grandfather as a kid,0
heeeeey what about an oscar nominations reacton commentary video there s definitely some choices to talk about,0
i agree that j k simmons was a perfect casting choice although that can be said for every other movie he stars in he just absolutely kills every role he s put in just take whiplash for example who can imagine anyone else playing his character,0
finish it finish it,0
mj really sucks in the later films though watch nc s comparison in old vs new with spiderman,0
i hope he points out how ridiculous it was for peter parker quitting being spiderman just because it s hard in spiderman,0
wow i was in the exact same situation when i first saw this film i had a big crush on a girl at the time as well cool to know someone has a similar personal connection to this film as i do thanks for sharing dude,0
academy awards nominations please chris,0
oscar nominees chris i ve been avoiding the news,0
i don t know how they could top toby with anyone else,0
thank you yes this is actually a really great movie that is still holding up a few years ago i was going to introduce my kods to spiderman movies and i made the very conscious choice of this one over the rebooted version it just nailed the uncle ben scene there is no better jj jonahson in the universe and the green goblin battle was phenomenal also spiderman had alfred molina as doc ock you can t beat that never knew defoe thought to get the part love him for that,0
lol the s music i d forgotten how hilarious that is,0
in i was like but i still clearly remember seeing this movie and loving it spiderman was my favorite superhero until onwards when i saw the dark knight and played lego batman and arkham asylum and realized that batman was my true lord and saviour,0
i really enjoyed this review i loved this movie as a kid as well as the rest of the trilogy that said i am looking forward to seeing chris tear spider man to pieces lol,0
just a quick question chris why haven t you reviewed legend the tom hardy film,0
whats best a or a,0
great comic book movie and possibly my favorite comic book movie of all time as far as the darkness in these movies i find this movie in particular to actually be the darkest and most rami ish than the others in the trilogy due to the final fight all the gollum esque scenes of norman speaking with his alter ego as well as the scene where the goblin bursts into aunt may s room while saying the lord s prayer also going back to chris s point about mj having a party girl persona that she switches on i totally agree and find a parallel in that regard to both peter and norman that is peter s alter ego of spider man gives him the persona he needs to actually give him more confidence in talking to mj and norman s alter ego of the goblin gives him the persona he needs to actually fulfill his deep dark desires of getting rid of the people in the way of his corporate success leading him to seek even greater power,0
i thought the whole point of wearing masks was so the stunt men could do the action stuff,0
so do you think deadpool is going to be a dick or is it expected from him to make too many jokes,0
when will the next one come out,0
i wonder if new blade and ghost rider films will ever be made or maybe a tv series didn t marvel recently get the film rights for ghost rider back from sony,1
i would actually like the new mcu if they captured the same charm that this movie and spiderman did this movie did not feel like a generic superhero movie and felt original this movie did fun comic book movie right and didn t feel formulaic like marvel movies are nowadays,0
seeing yourself in peter and mj i feel you man but i saw it in the first amazing spider man film,0
i love sam raimi s spider man trilogy it s one of my favorite movie trilogies along with the lord of the rings trilogy the dark knight trilogy and the original star wars trilogy,0
i ll tell you right now the only good spider man film ever made is spider man why because it s the only one that isn t trying to be a good spider man film sam raimi only did it for the money and tobey maguire couldn t wait to finish it and that s why it s got a certain kind of irreverence i like it just doesn t give a shit,0
sam raimi s spider man for the win,0
when i watched this film recently i realize that it look like a comic book the colors the animation the caracters the diector take the history from comic books and change it into a movie i really think that movie is incredible is amazing almost perfect it is a classic that i will always watch it and remember how good it is,0
i am so happy you did this one thank you,0
chris please do an oscar nominations reaction video i beg you,0
as the seats filled up i meant,0
this has and always will be my favourite movie of all time i grew up with it still watch it today and i am so glad chris gave it a good grade also i never even noticed the dinner scene that just blew my mind d,0

spider man yea good job getting your ass beat lol,1
why did you have to take a shoot at the mcu int the beginning,0
i always liked this spider man and all of its subsequent films not the cgi tho just freakin ridiculous why people harped on it later is beyond me toby mcguire did the best reboot ever rami did awesome thx for the review,0
hey chris i watched spider man before you posted the review thank you,0
nothing will ever be better than this movie like i know filmmaking wise that s not a true statement but like this movie is just iconic as it is i was obsessed with spiderman throughout my childhood and i even wrote short movies in high school,0
tasty bass on that live action spider man show fantastic review chris i m that exact person that jumped the cynical bandwagon over things i myself don t really care about all that much like the suit looking like a power ranger villain etc watched it recently and i gotta agree with ya,0
excellent review chris cant wait for your review of amazing spider man has anyone seen the deleted alternate scenes from tasm i can t help but feel had marc webb gone for those instead of what was ultimately used the movie would have been much better anyone have thoughts on this,1
spider man a my favorite spider man a spider man b,0
tony maguire and robert downey jr are the best casting for superhero characters,0
spider man is my favorite superhero,0
you missed supaidah man,0
react to oscars noms,0
i think i enjoy this movie more now than i did when i was younger,0
i love this movie i agree with chris i hate when people look back at fun movies like this just to trash them and make fun of how much better cgi is now if you were a teenager or kid when this movie came out you loved it not everything has to be dark and brooding to be good,0
i love that shirt so much must have,0
peter don t tell harry dieded xp,0
one of my favorite soundtracks,0
as a child i use to watch this movie every day i still love it to this day william defoe performance as green goblin was fantastic when ever i watch the raimi spiderman trilogy i always want them to make spiderman and with the same cast spider man a spiderman a spiderman c the amazing spiderman a the amazing spiderman b,0
i agree with your review i rewatched the entire trilogy a few months ago and sm and were really really well made and great superhero films the comedic timing and jokes were spot on not overdone yet not chldish jk simmons was spectacular and hilarious in his role the story line and the relationship between mj and pp was also very well done they captured the emotional defeats and victories extremely well those were characters that anyone in their position can relate to for me sm a sm a sm c,0
so you re you look like lol,0
speaking of sam raimi maybe the evil dead franchise review next,0
so looking forward to the spiderman review dd,0
another happy super hero movie guardians of the galaxy,0
raimi and tobey rock,0
hey chris i hoped you did a live reactions for the oscars,1
as for the point about bus drivers you d be surprised i remember a few instances of them taking off with a kid running behind who was just lagging a little too much and i also had one particular driver who actually took part in making fun of this one sort of weird kid that everyone was making fun of on the bus it was really surreal,0
spider man is awesome great opening great music great acting great story great portrayals i remember being years old watching it in the movie theater it was awesome,0
do a live reaction of the oscar nominations,1
i saw this movie in the theater and thought it sucked so did my brother haven t seen any of them in the theater since feel like spiderman is in the same tier as the shitty fantastic four movies,0
where is the video d,0
review the x men movies dooo ittt,0
for a year and a half i ve been have been telling everyone who pay attention my family and friends how important spiderman is please play this game look around for one week at how much spiderman you see in public,0
god damn i never consider spider man among my favorites but every single time it get s mentioned i go fuck yeah i love spider man,0
i always thought goblin looked badass,0
i honestly cant understand those who liked tas movies more both were pretty meh while from raimi s movies atleast the first two were good,1
well how about when the green goblin got killed as he dies getting it in the man marbles,0
well this came out of nowhere,0
thank you for doing this chris keep andrew garfield as spiderman,0
yeah no matter what i can t deny the collective euphoria fervor and timing of this film cuz when it came out it was certainly one of a kind,0
predictions spider man a spider man c amazing spider man b amazing spider man d,0
i love the original spider man it is so much more relatable to teens one of my biggest petpeeves about the amazing spiderman is that the webs aren t organic instead they re from the webshooters that he makes which i also question where did he get the money to make them the casting is incredible my spiderman will always be tobey maguire i also agree that not too many jokes were necessary they made a subtle comedic world for peter with good jokes and funny scenes the green goblin s bomb was meant to incinerate his victims i guess that s why the skeletons appear i really loved this film as a kid spiderman was the reason why i got into superhero movies and i paid more attention to new movies that came every year and the casting of actors it will always be one of my favorites,0
speaking of x files i got an x files ad after this vid,0
ah spider man i m like you chris in that i remember going to the theater we got really crappy seats the ones in the very front this movie has a very special place in my heart i always liked sam raimi the evil dead franchise showcased to me how talented he was and how this guy should make bigger blockbusters and this is a common theme most of the big name directors did do b rated movies heck look at james wan he s transitioned out of horror films which he had done a fantastic job and i do not like many horror movies but i digress this film in one word was fun it was campy and over the top sometimes it was a tad bit too much but a lot of people tend to forget that was what spider man was during the s but this film wasn t afraid to get serious by nailing the core of who peter parker was it honestly delivered a really heartfelt story and for that you have to give sam raimi credit a lot of us tend to forget that superheroes back then weren t as big as today sure there was x men but given batman and robin and steel and all those pieces of garbages they were looked down and for sam raimi to take a character who is arguably one of if not the most popular superhero in the world and make a film about him must have been massive especially considering as what i stated above superhero films weren t looked at as positively as they are now so overall sam raimi s accomplishment should be noted but regardless despite the flaws i love this film many people say star wars was their childhood nostalgia despite me being a diehard star wars fan i like both the ot and the pt i never grew up with them aside from the pt this trilogy i grew up with so it holds a very special place in my heart,0
that guy should be dead at,0
i dont agree all that much now watching all the originals i seriously cant stand mary jane and its good enough movie with some great moments it a b or something but its not as great really my biggest isssue is spiderman peter parker he was nerdy in the first one but in all the others i wish he evolved more funny as spiderman and stronger and less goofy as peter parker but this movie has a great place in my heart because in my childhood i watched it like time or something xd,0
i actually like that i wish more comic book movies were cheesy,0
i still remember watching this movie on the opening weekend on the last fight scene when spider man is getting his ass kicked some little kid screams spider man get up it was epic everyone started laughing,0
i very often agree with chris in his reviews but not this time i grew up with this movie when i was a kid it was probably one of my favorites but when i watched it again just before going to watch the amazing spider man in theaters i almost felt the nostalgia goggles falling off from my eyes this movie is at several points almost unbearably cheesy i seriously couldn t believe my eyes rewatching it it has good moments sure and a good score and good casting etc but on the spectrum that goes from good movie with some problems to bad movie with some good moments chris put it closer to the former i think he was too dismissive with the film s problems whereas i d put it somewhere in the middle it s not a bad movie just disappointing imo i d probably give it a c maybe a b by stretching it but an a that s more than it deserves,1
its nice to see people realizing that origina spiderman movies are the best,0
bonesaw is readyyyyyy,0
spider man a spider man ii a spider man iii c the amazing spider man b not a bad movie but its an unnecessary reboot of spider man origin story the amazing spider man ii f,0
this movie has aged like milk for me dafoe s performance was so goofy the suit looked terrible macguire s performance was annoying and mary jane was a terrible character it s not a bad movie by any means but wow it has not aged well i have similar thoughts about the first x men movie,0
rip alan rickman sad face,0
spoiler warning for movie from does someone thinks he is entitled for that kind of catering and you think you ow that catering i wish you would not,0
godspeed spider man,0
i think all marvel movies being in one universe is a very good think plus its not like all they fuoces on is setting up other movies of marvel cu movies are amazing,0
spider man b spider man a spider man b amazing spider man b amazing spider man b my biggest gripe with this film is that mj didn t even get a scratch on her during the whole bridge scene in the comic it was based off of gwen stacy and we know what happened there in the animated series mj gets lost in another dimension and it tears peter apart with rage even as censored as that show was on this movie i would have like to see her at least get knocked unconscious for awhile,0
do you feel they should ve let raimi continue to make a spiderman or did you agree with them needing to reboot it there could ve been redemption for the third movie with raimi but what we got was an ok reboot and a horrible sequel to it,0
best spiderman hands down didn t like the new ones,0
thumbs up for the jj impression,0
don t tell harry,0
are you going to do a live reaction to the oscar nominations this year,0
chris i hope you do a reaction to the oscar nominations again,0
love that shirt,0
who else laughed when green goblin at the end says oh shit,0
danny elfman this is halloween beetlejuice augustus goop spiderman the simpsons batman and edward scissorhands and the list just goes on and on and on i just love that mans creativity,1
can you do a reaction to the oscar nominations,1
i watched one if your videos and now i am stuck on your channel,1
spider man and dark knight still rank as my top superhero films ever,0
don t know as i watch the s cbm they all seem cheesy and simple x men just look like a wolverine with his mutants friends movies and spiderman is a kids movie i think when batman begins came out it changed the movies for me,0
chris stuckmann can you review all the harry potter films before fantastic beast,1
haha stupid nerd you re dumb yeah see you later kid i m gonna get fired later hahahahahhahahahaha,1
chris check out oscar nominations i was pretty surprised,1
sam raimi vs marc webb spiderman vs the amazing spiderman who win,0

chris where did you get that shirt it s awesome,0
bro you re just awesome that s all i wanted to say here,0
fuck yeah spiderman,0
you think spider man is a good movie oh chris my sweet summer child,0
i ve already seen the glider,0
thank you chris i m really excited for the series of reviews,0
honestly i love the sam raimi spiderman films better than the marc webb ones i love how the webbing was organic and came along with his powers sucks that spiderman got fucked up and there was no spiderman,0
chris looks a little bit like paul rudd,0
awesome been waiting for this good job chris also rip alan rickman,0
the reasoning behind the organic webs is fanboyish spiders use their saliva for webbing so,0
rest in peice aan rickman,1
my favorite spider man movie and maybe my favorite super hero movie,0
i think if the green goblin s mouth moved he wouldn t look too much like a power ranger the mouth not moving always annoyed me other then that i always loved this film eventhough i m not a big kirsten dunst fan,0
you could say it was really that good glad to see all this appreciation for raimi s spiderman considering the decade of pissants calling it lame for not being batman,0
wait why are you complaining about super hero movies these day being too dark when ur favourite is the dark knight anyway all the marvel movies are fun and bright like spiderman some times u confuse me chris,0
this is my favorite spider man movie fun tense and joyful unlike amazing spider man which was bleh bleh and barf,0
toby s peter parker was ok but you didn t get the impression that he was smart like really smart i think andrew gardield s has the edge on that as you believe that he s tony stark smart,0
lol the people who disliked the vid are those that enjoyed tasm,0
in a video about the spider man review chris put the spider man blue ray behind him and then he noticed that in the dinner scene all the characters were dressed in the other ones colours when he makes his own film i swear i ll dedicate a whole year to find all the easter eggs and references,0
some spiders change colors to blend into their environment it s a defense mechanism,0
jk simmons in spiderman was the funniest when he was trying to take his pills i couldn t stop laughing,1
my thoughts i agree the raimi movies are better made films than the reboot but the reboot just had a more interesting tone to it for me i wanted to see it continue while the raimi films were just okay in their own right tobey mcguire was just so doofy that i couldn t get into the character as much as i could garfield who just had more charisma the cgi in that first movie is awful it never looked real i love what chris said about regurgitation of ideas i feel that s what s happening with tfa someone reads something and decides that s their opinion too rather than actually thinking hard about it it s even worse when they read the comments first and then watch it so they already have that opinion coloring how they decide to view it,1
really annoys me when people say screw andrew garfield s spider man movies i understand they aren t great but andrew garfield himself did not make the films mark webb made them with interjection from sony well it s safe to say sony made a crap ton of unneeded changes blame the people making the film not the actors,0
attack of the killer tomatoes pls do this movie review i did not find any,0
spiderman was just the best spiderman movie,0
i like spider man more than any other comic book film spider man is the empire strikes back of comic book movies and even spider man was in my eyes a lot better than amazing spider man or i liked pretty much every character in the series with an exception to gwen stacey and venom those were just misscast in my opinion everything else was awesome and i really wish they didn t fuck over sam raimey amazing spider man was such garbage,0
review evil dead series,0
review evil dead series,0
rip alan rickman,1
well if you think this movie holds up and deserves an a minus which i totally agree with then prepare for spiderman which is the best superhero film ever made period,0
good movie i prefer the nd though and imo is one of the best comic book movies ever made,0
hahaha worst objective review youve done chris this movie hasnt held up at all,0
i was only when this movie came out and i remember back then being obsessed with spider man and for the little girl that i was finally seeing on screen actual real people portraying the characters and especially spider man peter parker it was truly mind blowing the movie still holds up so well for me and well with x men two movies i still love to death up to this day,0
i think of myself as serious no nonsense guy but this movie brings out nothing but smile on my face when chris spoke about crawling on walls i was instantly reminded of my growing up years because that s what i did tobey maguire s casting equals to christopher reeve as superman hate spider man but i prefer that over the tasm series which was boring and bland the only thing that worked was emma stone as gwen stacy,0
subbed,0
i wanted tobey maguire to play spider man in the civil war movie,0
i just watched this last night weird,0
the biggest problem with this movie that i have is the weird stalker way that tobey maguire acts in the starting scenes like the starting scene where he accidentally waves his at mj my mind was like stalker alert,0
tobey macguire was sooo cute back then cx,0
finally you reviewed the raimi s spider man thanks,0
oh how i love the original spidey films are you gonna do the amazing spideys too,0
gosh chris i fuckin love your videos so much like oh my gods,0
second best spiderman film,0
spiderman hour chick flick with some action,0
booonne sssaww is rrreaaddiii,0
don t forget chris do the react to oscars nomination this year,0
this is still my favorite from all the sm movies looking forward to the next reviews,0
spider man yeaah i love that d i love that d,0
sam raimi s spiderman films were better but i preferred andrew garfield and emma stone to tobey mcguire and kirsten dunst tobey mcguire was pretty good but yeah i wanted more humor from him and less crying he was a bit too soft for me but kirsten dunst just pissed me off didn t like her at all she was just a damsel in distress i found her boring with andrew garfield now i thought he was more charismatic and likeable he was a bit too cool to be peter parker but he nailed it as spiderman his voice and his humor were on point emma stone knocked it out of the park for me as gwen stacy she was smart witty and even when she needed saving it was because she had put herself in danger to do something brave and helpful unfortunately the amazing spiderman and its sequel weren t quite as good as the originals but they were still enjoyable,0
great video your reviews are really convincing i personally prefer andrew garfield as spidey but you have given me new appreciation for toby s casting could you not have played some of the score to demonstrate your point it s one of my all time favourite themes,0
on paper spiderman is my favourite comic book character i m still hoping one day i will see a good film garfield was perfect casting to me and hollywood completely blew it s chance i don t have any hope for spider kid hated tobey,0
the casting is pretty much perfect kirsten dunst really,1
what i can t stand from this movie is how peter is a total socially awkward dork trampled on by everyone comics peter was a reject because of his nerd status but he did have social skills and plenty of charisma already he just preferred to mind his own science business it was a cheap retread of reeve s clark kent dorky persona hell a lot of cliches here were easy play it safe reeve superman stuff because back then that s what people considered a superhero movie to be,0
the thing i hate the most that yes the dark knight movie from was awesome but later it became so popular that every superhero movie are going the same dark and sad type of style prolems with marvel movies nowdays they executed superheroes well but the villians feel really cheap and not threataning at all of course people prase loki propablly because he has good looks and every girl falls for him even tho he is a villian mcu needs to make villians feel important aswell and sometimes they should go darker routes for their movies age of ultron could have been like the darkest marvel movie ever but then they effed it all up by making ultron one of the most powerfull and dangerous villians into a loki clone like wtf problems with recent dc movies they are going the same the dark knight route and make dc movies too dark and too serious and they are just rushing everything because dc can t stop their rivalrly against marvel and put some effort into their superheroes they are focusing too much batman that they don t give enough time to write good stories for other superheros like superman wonder woman green latern etc,0
this was the only movie besides parts of where mary jane actually had some character smh i mean was it really that hard to give her anything to do,0
i don t particularly love the first two spider man movies in fact i think spider man at times has some pretty awful dialogue and just flat out hur durr writing but the nostalgia and feel i get from them is great i mean like many i don t like nickelback but remembering the feeling from listening to hero as a kid there s just something so distinct about it also another very nostalgic memory is when i was a little tyke when the world seemed infinitely larger than i feel now i was looking up at the poster for spider man in theaters it was really big keep in mind and was also the first time i saw it as well as first confirmation the movie was even happening it was such a surreal awe capturing moment it felt as though i was up in the sky with spider man a completely indescribable feeling somewhat off topic from the review but i love raimi despite not loving his spider man films while also simultaneously loving comics i would love to see him get another crack at the character at marvel jon watts can do a trilogy while sam raimi does a venom film and drew goddard who wrote the martian but abandoned directing it as well as showrunning daredevil to do sinister six only to have it shitcanned and sent off to marvel to do a sinister six film so basically sony s plan from the beginning but much more inspired considering it is within the marvel machine and raimi won t be forced to do anything and venom is very much in line with raimi s sort of s spider man sensibilities both sinister six and the venom film should be spider man centric though i don t know i just love this idea because it would create spider man s world within a larger world and it would make his lore much more diverse and creatively fresh plus spidey has too much material to cover in just movies alone,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man d,0
the scene where peter is trying to spin a web still leaves me laughing silly what a great movie,0
what a pleasant surprise it was to see this video spider man is such a classic never gets old your analysis of mj is spot on that s exactly how she is in the comics as well she has different sides to her personality and the party girl side is an act most of the time your reading of colours was insightful i never noticed that before the fact that harry was wearing both their colours is genius on so many levels especially because in spider man he redeems himself after taking up the goblin persona something he did in the comics too bravo sam raimi,1
tobey garfield,1
sam raimi s spiderman will always be the best,1
the best spider man thing other than comics is the spectacular spider man tv show,0
i mean i love sm and but the third ist sooo cheasy xd so that i cant say sm is one of my favorit franchis,0
nice review with interesting details but although i was a big spiderman fan i was already at the time and was disappointed i would have prefered the demeanor of the new deadpool to portray spiderman minus the violence of course i don t want my spidey to be gritty and dark but a bit cynical and mean from time to time he s a teenager s hero and he should carry some teenage drama and toughness it s not all made from candy in these years,0
what is a superhero s favourite type of rice uncle bens,1
chris please review requiem for a dream,0
andrew garfield is by far a better spider man than tobey,0
yep i still like the first spiderman film instead of the amazing spiderman film,0
love that you re doing these movies i recently re watched all of the spiderman s and they are my favourite superhero movies maybe not so much but spiderman is definitely my favourite superhero and i m really looking forward to anxious to see how they portray him in civil war and the new movies i m just going to pretend the amazing spiderman s don t exist,0
spiderman and are still the best and my favorite,0
this review is spot on the internet is nothing but nerd rage where people think it s cool to hate everything i miss characters with morals that do the right thing because it s the right thing to do great review dude,1
i actually liked the green goblin suit in the movie spider man was a fantasticly fun,0
i knew this movie wasn t as bad as people said it was i still enjoy watching it years on,0
imho best peter tobey but best spiderman is andrew,0
it still bugs me till this day that people think amazing spiderman is better than this i just dont know whether it is becuz i grew up with this film but this film has a look more fun depth and excitement but apparently to the general crowd these days that just becuz webb did a good job with the romance scene amazing is better,0
i prefer the amazing spiederman movies to the raimi trilogy,0
hi chris is there a chance for you to review the hayao miyazaki studio ghibli films your in deep analysis would be greatly challenged in these movies,0
that is one badass shirt,0
i want to see a spider man noir and other alternative spider man movies on the big screen,0
surprised you didn t mention the marketing issue relating to the twin towers sequence i think in terms of mood it s also significant that this was one of the last few pre movies superheroes became darker immediately after that too,0
all of raimi s spider man movies were good even the first amazing spider man was decent but the second was so fucking trash,0
james horner is dead since when james horner and james newton howard are two of my favorite film scorers,0
i loved the first half of spider man but for me the movie always went downhill in the nd half imo willem dafoe s goblin was too hammy partly because of the bad looking suit then there s the part where they use the gwen stacey death scene from the comic and render it completely pointless i like the movie overall but it was a b for me and i thought spider man was far superior,0
yeah but somtimes in the spiderman comics he over quips but not deadpool level of over quiping he dose this to frustrate the badguys so that they lose focus so that spidey can get the upper hand and out strategy them,0
didn t a spider man movie come out in released by t ei,0
i love the original spider man trilogy sooo much,1
my only problem with the casting of green goblin is that he would be perfect for carnage also i m so glad you are reviewing these movies loving your content these days brother,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman d the amazing spiderman a the amazing spiderman a i loved the andrew garfield films and tobey but sm was bad,0
i loved this movie as a kid and later too were it lacked in effects it delivered in heart uncle ben s death always makes me chocked up and that peter was the cause of it damn osborne family were great too none of my friends agree though tobey maguire is not cool enough and they all remember only bad parts of the movie andrew garfield as a quirky hipster suits them better he is closer to kids of this generation but the movies in general were worse,0
chris i saw the grandmaster in your blu ray collection but man that is not the one you should watch you should watch the real og ipman starring donnie yen for the love of god freaking watch it and review it if you truly love martial arts,0
my biggest gripe with raimi s spider man movies were the mask good grief it came off a lot it is like they wanted any excuse to show maguire s mug i hated the reboots both sucked ass especially amazing spider man but one thing they did do right was the costume and best yet the mask stayed on the whole time,0
the power rangers suit for green goblin was a hold over from the michael keaton batman era of the late s they beefed up batman from tights to something a little more like body armor and that look caught on in things like power rangers sam raimi had to fight to prevent spidey from having to wear clunky power rangeresque body armor imagine if spiderman had been wearing a chunky red helmet like goblin had to wear the concession was that spidey s suit had to at least have raised d webbing over the mask arms and legs and green goblin had to stay klunky but could be shot without his shitty helmet in close up scenes raimi continued to push this actors without masks thing in the next two spidey movies in spidey you see spiderman without the mask a lot and even in every close up of venom has the black goo peeling away to reveal topher grace s face delivering the lines raimi destroyed the power ranger asthetic going on in hollywood at the turn of the century and softened the ground of other great superhero flicks to really take off as the twenty teens began the first iron man is greatly informed by what raimi did on this score yes iron man should seem like the ultimate plastic cgi power ranger but it didn t come off that way because of all the close ups of tony stark inside the helmet talking to jarvis you never forget who is inside that suit and behind that mask that said despite everything willam defoe did a spectaular job as green goblin in the first spider man even if he had to be the last power ranger my only other comment i agree that biologial web shooters make a lot more sense for peter to have invented tech web shooters in his uncle s house would have been a stretch because where did he get the money to develop this and even if he had why not just patent the tech and make bank while allowing first responders everywhere to use it for saving lives i don t know what they ll do with future spiderman movies but i do think raimi created a couple classics that will stand the test of time,0
great review again,0
i loved the end fight with the goblin it s rumored or actually stated that the original fight was way more violent but was cut from the film because the kiddos alas i could never find the supposed shot footage of the longer and more brutal fight not to mention it was bloodier i expected to find the footage from the re release on the blu rays but couldn t find anything,0
please react to batman v superman weird trailer you will not regret it i died watching it this comment was sent from the afterlife,0
mr stuckmann could you review disney little mermaid,0
chris we share the exact same opinion and the thanksgiving scene is one of my favorites in the movie cause it establishes every character perfectly and i also noticed the color thing as a kid god i was such a nerd,0
guys please don t over hype the new spiderman in civil war cause he might pull off a luke skywalker and be in the film for like minute i mean we haven t seen him in any of the trailers,0
i watched spiderman times in on vhs fucking top film top film,1
i hope chris does this with the xmen movies,0
maybe it s better to say what you didn t grow up on,0
chris i know it s a little too much but you must review x men before spider man this was a big landmark in comic book movies before batman begins this was one of the most realistic dark ones too honestly i wished they made a spider man too bad sony were a bunch of dicks,0
was there anything that wasnt a part of your childhood,0
i totally agree with you and why the all the new superheroes movies are trying to be dark everyone is trying to reacreate chritopher nolan formula aaaaaahh,0
how about you do a video choosing the people you think should be awarded at the razzies just a suggestion there are a lot of hard choices so i think it would be a fun video to watch,0
actually spiderman was my first hollywood theater experience,0
i always thought raimis spiderman was better than garfield s raimis feel like actual films with filmmaking the amazing ones feel like cash grabs and music videos,0
my favorite aspect of this movie is also the fact that spider man gets his ass kicked in the finale of the movie really upped the ante,0
finish it,0
sick shirt,0
chris maybe sometime in the future you could do like a filmaking video or a video on how to craft a good story for up and coming film makers just a thought,0
i recently watched the first two spidermans before this review came out and it is really a great movie the colors of the close at dinner i thought was really interesting,0
great review for me this movie was like how kids from the s talk about star wars it was incredible for year old me i remember after the movie running through the theater hallway jumping around swinging my hands pretending to shoot web with my little brother it was magical i also thought mary jane was the hottest girl ever ah simple times,0
chris i grew up with this stuckmann,0
back to formula,0
just wait til the spiderman review,1
chris i agree with everything you said but im just gonna be honest mary jane is a terribly written character she s just plot device for everyone to chase i realy wish asm s gwen had been in these films instead of mj other than that great review,0
love your videoes great review do more series like harry potter movies before fantastic beasts,0
thank goodness chris hasn t been drinking the amazing spider man kool aid,0
i absolutely loved blade as a kid i had a crush on frost i was six when it came out i think i watched it when i was eight years old about the same time i watched the shining i also watched bride of chucky spending some family time with my dad and little brother,0
are you doing a most anticipated movies of,0
he stinks and i don t like him,0
chris did you get wizard magazine growing up that was pretty much the internet back then lol all the articles and rumors and behind the scenes hell they did a couple of issues talking bout the spiderman movies,0
it s a film made by people chris stuckmann,1
totally agree with everything you ve said,0
make a review for an a movie,0
my bus driver would do that,0
mary jane watson was sooo bad in this trilogy every scene with her made me cringe,0
can you please make a review for jaws and jaws review or hilariocity doesn t matter jaws is my favorite movie and i guess i saw your hilariocity of jaws about times thanks,0
spiderman is my childhood favourite super hero so thank you for this review chris,0
reads comments i think i m the only one who loved the amazing spider man,0
with great power comes great review awesome review chris keep it up,0
first time i have to completely disagree with you maguire was awful as peter parker with his cringe worthy acting honestly can t understand why you think he was the best,0
i agree with the organic web shooters,0
this is easily my favorite comic book movie ever i still don t know why the internet shits on tobey he will always be spider man to me,0
its a film made by people,0
this series better end with the amazing spider man getting ripped a new asshole or else i will be mildly annoyed for a few moments before carrying on with my day,0
thank you so much for making this video i grew up in this trilogy as well and my dad got into spiderman and she we watched all of these and i had all the figures and everything i loved it so much and i even like the third one but the amount of identifying i m doing with you through this is amazing thank you so much for making this series,0
the details and technicalities you put into doing these reviews really show how much you love it,0
when i was a kid seeing this in the theater the green goblin actually terrified me and i had nightmares for days hahahah,0
i remember how it really ticked me off how spider man got beat up so bad it makes sense though he s only had his powers for what a month or two he redeemed himself in spider man though,0
and yes even raimi s spider man is a lot better than that piss poor film they called the amazing spider man,0
oh yes more love for raimi s spidey flicks i hate how people compare this to the new one which isn t fair at all this movie was made during a time where the superhero genre is getting back up on its legs again it innovated a lot for the subsequent superhero movies that came after it a solid a movie for me classic,0
tobey mcguire s facial expressions in every single action scene kirsten dunst as a mousey mary jane the most awkward and awful rendition of your family neighborhood spider man ever put on media etc,0
uuuuum what happens to me when i get stuckmanized,1
hey chris dragon ball evolution,0
it s funny that he did a review for this and going to review the other spider man movies because i just finished re watching all of them this past christmas,0
i also worked on a school bus with disabled kids for a time chris represent,0
i think spider man is a great movie but i think you re over rating it i think today s standards have fallen to a point where the dark knight is among imdb s top of all time and original films appear twice a year i remember loving that movie for the st two times i watched it but i watched it over times the following year and it is full of flaws dunst and franco s acting for example relative to most of what we re getting now i agree it s good and it is the best spider man movie to date but that s it,0
this review makes me watch the sam raimi s trilogy again,0
hey chris i love your channel you re brilliant can you please do a review on the theory of everything,0
r i p toby fernando david bowie,0
damn it now i wanna watch spider man again,1
i hope one day tobey and kirsten can team up again and co star in another movie the way leo and kate winslet did revolutionary road,0
i honestly love this movie as much as it is a favorite of my childhood and i agree it holds up today the fight at the end between spidey and the goblin is one of my favorite fights in a movie just the way it feels spidey getting his butt kicked and fighting for his life it gets an a from me,0
review room,0
come on chris review the godfather trilogy come on do it do it strike them out and your journey towards the classic side will be complete in emperor s voice,0
could you do a hilarious review for nightbreed i just watched it on netflix for some reason and it was so bad,0
when will you review the shawshank redemption,0
amazing spider man spider man spiderman amazing spiderman dogshit spiderman,0
this movie was my childhood this movie is something that hits me on a very very emotional level thank you a lot for reviewing it i love this trilogy with my heart,1
bonesaw is ready,0
spider man is probably my favorite comic book origin story movie,0
i honestly think this is one of the best reviews you ve ever done marvelous job sir,0
this movie will have a special place in my heart my little brother who is now absolutely loved this movie we didn t get to watch it in theaters but we did enjoy it at the comfort of our home all of my siblings sister and brothers would have a blast watching this movie we would even reenact it my sister who now is refuses to watch the newer spiderman series because she thinks no one can be spiderman besides tobey mcguire even the soundtrack is good,0
this may be the second movie i ever watched in theater it was hit in india back then one of the first hollywood movies dubbed in local language,0
awesome review chris spiderman is the best superhero no matter what,0
im so tired of people thinking spiderman is a nerd have yall actually read the original comics andrew garfield was way closer maguire was great though no doubt,0
i love spider man this is awesome chris and i i like the s cartoon as well,0
would love to see a review on the witch,0
even the worst film in the original trilogy is better than both films in the new one or old now andrew garfield movies are fucking awful is what i m saying,0
go go go web go,0
i loved the movie and i could identify with spidey a lot the only thing i didn t like that much was the green goblin custome it was a waste of williem dafoe the best part of green goblin in the movie are the ones when he is talking with himself without the mask,1
it still hold up to this day sorry tasm,0
b imo love willem da goblin tho,0
spider man is to me the best in the series and i think will stand that way for a long time unless marvel really does something new and special with it chris points out everything right with it here the cast the action the plot everything is done so well here this movie holds up so much better imo than spider man because the cgi in spider man do is used much more extensively and constitutes much more of the action scenes than in this movie i m glad this video points out the final fight scene i too loved how gritty it was it was great seeing spider man s face all torn up like that how we often saw it in like the mcfarlane comics it was really the perfect spider man movie it was corny enough to be charming but at the same time had the depth to the characters that was missing in sm and toby is really good in this movie but to me he really checks out in and i also really really love that this movie ends on kind of a dark note he doesn t get the girl and he has to live with that as part of his burden as spider man,0
i guess i m watching spider man tonight,0
this was a great review i love when you go back and review a whole series of movies the way you talk about them always makes me go back and rewatch the films too thanks,0
i wish you would do all the s saturday morning cartoons review,0
did you see tom petty in the movie,0
always thought everyone hated this movie but i ve always loved it glad chris does too,0
i think sam rami should get another shot at a spider man movie with disney backing him he could make a great movie now it says something that these movies still stand up today,0
chris who was your favorite power ranger have you heard of kamen rider and super sentai,0
i love the opening to this danny elfman s score was just triumphant love the whole movie today,0
thank you chris stuckmann i had forgotten how good this spider man movie was i like humor in superhero movies while the current ones reflect our times as much as fantasy i wish there were more movies in the tone of ant man and guardians of the galaxy,0
i want to rewatch the movie after seeing this movie,1
spider man is was favorite superhero movie for a long time until guardians came out then it tied,0
leats i wana use a line from the movies too but it looks like you you didnt left much well if this one is still free how is the pie so goood one of the most funniest scenes of all movies in my opinion,0
this movie introduced me to the world of spiderman and now i am an avid fan of him i never really like the amazing spiderman movies i much prefer the original trilogy,0
spot on review pretty much what i think of the movie such a classic,0
andrew garfiled was a better spiderman but toby maguire was a better peter parker,0
hey chris what are your thoughts about that jar jar is the main sith theory that s getting popular,0
the first spiderman came out when i was a kid didn t like it i still like spiderman but even back then i didn t like what they did with him the arc with harry osborn is good but overall i could do without it i liked amazing spiderman better but that has its issues too the trouble is nobody seems to know how to write good spiderman,0
so is it official spidey will be in civil war,0
chris are you aware about spider man and power rangers past connection research into the japanese spider man series produced by toei and marvel and read up on its connection to super sentai,0
dane dehaan s goblin makeup is so much cooler and less distracting that dafoe s costume mask and voice,0
pls do spiderman imo the second one was better in fact a lot of sequels are arguably than the originals some examples are star wars the empire strikes back and the dark knight cant think of anymore lol,0
can t wait for you to do spiderman,0
you re not goin noweheres i gotcha for threeeee minutes,0
the last bit was hands down my favourite part of the movie there s a point about midway and i think you almost had it going in the background where all the fantastical super hero stuff just ends and it becomes two ppl just tearing the shit out of each other,0
thank you spider man for giving us better superhero movies one of my favorite,0
i m curious chris and anyone who reads this comment what do you think of the song hero by chad kroeger i know nickelback gets a lot of hate but i think that song is just so great and makes me think of spiderman every time it was my favorite song when this movie came out thoughts,0
thank you chris for reminding us of the time when spider man movies were actually good,0
misery misery that s what you ve wrought,0
for spider man you should consider doing a collab review with theflickpick,0
chris have you watche the spectacular spider man animated series if not definitely check it out it s one of the best interpretations of spider man ever created,0
hey chris have you checked out the japanese spider man show they basically turned him into a one man super sentai team complete with his own giant robot,0
could you make a review about the movie mr nobody,0
i can t wait until he reviews spider man,0
yeeeees thank you chris stuckmann i ve been waiting for you to do this,0
great review stuckmann as always and i share that love for spider man it would be great if you did top films list by decade it is impossible to do an all time list,0
chris as a fellow spider man fan trust me when i say you have got to watch the spectacular spider man animated series,0
spider man a spider man ii a spider man iii c the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man ii f,0
where is the vampires kiss hilariocity,0
i agree with your rating chris,0
since everyone is doing it spider man b spider man a spider man d the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man f,0
my thoughts at hey ma guess who i am maaaaaa i m spidermaaaaan,0
i just realized something the third acts of all spiderman movies took place at night,1
this movie is my childhood,0
these movies were my childhood,0
am i the only one who likes asm more than the original trilogy,0
the thing i most like abou this movie especially growing up with it is how easy it is to identify yourself with it as a teenager and like chris said it captures that very well it kinda inspiring,0
you do quite a good impression of j j jameson,0
nice to see someone who doesn t kiss up to the amazing spider man movies i also stand by my opinion that spider man and spider man are superior to the amazing spider man and the amazing spider man and not just for childhood nostalgia reasons unlike the latter films the first two are now classic superhero movies that existed before the age of gritty grounded or cinematic universe it s all connected because of that they have novelty to them like you said no cgi makes for real fights raimi should feel honored that his superhero movies are comparable to the original superman and batman ones,0
i really appreciate watching these vids especially when i see the n in the background with goldeneye in it very smart man,0
great movie awesome casting thanks for reviewing this mr stuckmann,0
i love that this movie was pushing an r rating when spider man gets punched in the face right in the camera they had to edit in spit because if they did blood they would have gotten an r rami directing pushes this movie,0
the way he was reviewing it sounded like an a or a,0
of his videos will include him saying i grew up watching enter movie show name here as a kid lol,1
you miss the bruce campbell cameo,0
i love that movie,0
is chris spiderman,0
who else is super excited to see chris scream curse words at the academy tomorrow,0
spider man spider man spider man asm asm,0
forget the fact that goblin looks like a power ranger ish kind of thing i just would have liked to have seen willem defoe actually act out the villain during confrontation scenes,0
am i the only one besides chris who has the same shirt,0
omg james horner died where have i been man we have lost a genius composer so sad,0
i enjoyed this review but i really dont think any of the spiderman movies are that great or hold up well i loved them to death as a kid though and this review makes me wanna rewatch them again,0
i will take the old spider man trilogy over the new films any day these films were my childhood,1
chris as a kid when i first saw the film the scene where green goblin tosses the pumpkin bomb that incinerated the flesh instantly off of the people on the balcony actually startled me,0
why do people always berate comic book movies as being dark and gritty the vast majority of them are not and the ones that are tdk dofp mos are pretty great honestly it has become frustrating to hear that in every review btw i love spiderman,0
bonesaw is reeaddyyy,0
i really don t get the hate for the amazing spider man movies even though tobey is a better peter parker andrew garfield is a much better spider man and emma stone is still the best superhero girlfriend in any comic book movie lizard is a fantastic villain and i even thought the team up of electro and harry was done really well in the second one i concur that rhino was useless but to call asm as crowded and messy as spider man is an insult and yes i watched stuckmann s faboying video and i agree with everything he says when it comes to fanboying i m not fanboying with the asm movies i thought they were good movies i m just throwing that out there before stuckmann takes the opportunity to rip them to shreds because i know he will half of his fanboying video was him saying how bad the asm movies were instead of telling us what fanboying was if he likes these first two movies better then that s fine but he better as heck not give spider man a better grade than them that movie is a mess,0
years old in you re not as old as i thought you were,0
th first spider man movies were fantastic,0
very good review as always,0
i remember watching this movie in the theater opening day and when spider man gets punched in slow motion by the green goblin a kid yelled no spider man noo,0
i actually think the green goblin suit was pretty cool especially the mask,0
if you re worried about spoilers you suck big time,0
you can do this to meeeeeeee i started this company haha do you know how much i sacrificed,0
also jk simmons is a fabulous actor and he did phenomenally great in the part of jameson he will always be jameson to me and cave johnson but that s a different story,0
i remember watching spider man x when i was a kid he was my favorite superhero when i was a kid i should watch this movie again great review,0
watched this movie to death on vhs this and rush hour childhood man lol bone saw is ready,0
sicario slip cover sticking out there,0
pretty much every kid did this if they were young enough,0
tobey maguire will always be spider man in my mind,1
i thought andrew garfield was amazing way better than maguire the movies were not as good as sam raimi s but andrew garfield is just way better my opinion tobey is good at me being nerdy and andrew is just cool,0
even though this movie wasn t intended to set up a universe or future films it did foreshadow the lizard by having dr connors in the movie even though this series was canceled before they could utilize him as the lizard,0
spiderman spiderman spiderman amazing spiderman amazing spiderman,1
i loved spiderman and stil do to this day the first time i saw the trailer for spiderman i was and in the theaters for spy kids i think it was and i fucking flipped my shit cause i never seen a spiderman movie and it was truly something special i never thought i would see yeah you had x men and blade before spiderman but spiderman is my favorite marvel superhero this movie is still quotable and awesome to this day,0
this movie in my eyes is a flawless one back in we didn t have it in cinemas here in macedonia but on shitty video cassettes from shitty video stores with shitty bootlegged quality still loved it knew the whole thing by heart watched it two three four times a day for a god damn year or so was a geek then still a geek more than ever now but there haven t been a movie in my lifetime that hyped me as much as raimi s spider man and even more important a movie that i loved as much as this one really excited for bvs i hope it s gonna be a close second to the one above,0
j k simmons as j jonah jameson is one of the best casting choices of all time,0
thanks chris for discussing the original spider man it was just awesome i loved it,0
you forgot to mention how great macho man was,0
,1
about the balance between funny quips and being an asshole that s what i am afraid for about deadpool movie i don t know if i want to see hours of deadpool quips,0
i have a felling spider man at most will only be in civil war for five minutes,0
you re wrong people aren t looking to make gritty movies about comic books nowadays they re actually doing the opposite the reason is because gritty films like daredevil elektra or the punisher didn t work on critical and financial terms but i m guessing you didn t watched those movies in theatres or even heard of them if you did then i don t understand why at you maked that comment,0
what i also loved about the original spider man movies is that it actually tried to say something being a hero isn t all about being cool and having everything be awesome doing the right thing means you really have to sacrifice when he had to turn mary jane down at the end it broke my heart but with great power comes great responsibility now the amazing spider man movies urghhh,0
the only good spider man is the s cartoon,0
its just funny to think that growing web out of your wrists is considered realistic it was a radioactive spider after so anything could happen also got to love the up up and away part like he had been reading superman comics or something,0
you gotta watch japanese spiderman and the electric company spiderman the spiderman twin towers trailer was still the best thing ever,0
awesome review bro,0
i can t see toby in any other movie because of this film,0
i loved this movie as a kid but it does not hold up for me personally i thought the entire cast with the exception of jk simmons as jameson was miscast especially kirsten dunst as mj super nostalgic but not that great imo,0
you rock chris stuckman,0
i love watching these reviews of older movies or like full series reviews keep it up chris,0
i normally don t disagree with you chris but toby the best spiderman that we got nope not even close if you count other media not just film far to be the best the first time i watch this movie i loved everything about it including the cast of toby and kirsten dunst but after reconnect reading the comics watching again the cartoons and at the time the spectacular spiderman show great rendition of spiderman if you are interesting of watch a good cartoon show jesus i realize how far from be accurate this casting was specially with mj kirsten was awful as this character the films terrible chemistry with toby all the way from the first to the last movie i know your updates thoughts about amazing spiderman are more like their are crap now sorry but as far i concern the only films that nailed peter parker are the amazing spiderman films no matter how many flaws the films critic say they have the casting there was great and andrew as parker is far more faithful than toby who pass half of these films making weird faces or crying what this film indeed is superior to the amazing series is in the story and tone that this film nailed the origin story of spidey is flawaless the support cast specially j k simmons as j johna jameson was perfect casting and his missing in the amazing series hurt those films a lot also william dafoe as norman osborne even with the horrible suit was amazing far better than the idiotic version in amazing spiderman i love that film but i can t deny that was stupid overall in my opinion what works in amazing is the central leads and the portrait of spiderman and peter parker as well as gwen stacy playing perfectly by emma and andrew what works in the raimi films is the support cast and great story and was cheesy crap and both films have excellent action sequences but yep i can recognize the good in both films as well as the bad sadly it looks like critics just wanted to see the bad in the amazing spiderman series anyway hope your update thoughts on the amazing spiderman series been at least less negative than the ones of your buddy john because i seriously think you have a better understanding of what make a good and really awful film and i don t see how the amazing series are awful perfect no but awful films c mon,0
regarding the argument about the web shooters technically peter was a scientific smart guy i mean you know those kids who built their own gadgets out of nothing but scraps that s who peter was supposed to be and i believe that s where the gripe of many fans came from it s not more realistic it s compromise and as for the quipping making him look like an asshole well i mean it s spidey quipping goes along with spider man like spaghetti goes with ketchup look at the spectacular spider man animated series that increase in quipping totally doesn t make him look like an asshole at all it not only stays faithful to the character but also makes everything more fun,0
i got you for minutes minutes of playtimmmmee,0
i honestly found very little enjoyment in this movie like it was watchable and all but sam raimi s corny type of direction he does with every movie it seems just doesn t work for me it s fine if you love corny sam raimi s corniness i will admit is more respectable than usual but i just can t i couldn t even finish spider man,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman d amazing spiderman a amazing spiderman c,0
could spider man have ended up as being a secondary mutant character in the x men when he was created as he is classified as a human mutate,0
imo the only good raimi spider man film was the second one the first one is just too cheesy and reminds me too much of burton s first batman i hate tobey as spider man he s not a nerd he s so socialy awkward someone would think he s mentally handicaped dafoe is way too over the top for my taste and most of the rest are just ok love jk simmons though also about the action and how s filmed imo it s just too clunky sure i like that it s real instead of just cgi and i give props to dafoe for making most of his stunts and all but it s filmed with way too close angles and it shows these actors are not real fighters if you re filming hand to hand combat have at least great coreography or stuntmen that know what the hell they re doing they re not the worst thing ever but they could be so much better,0
i love the older movies amazing spiderman sucks i wanted to see at least two more movies from the original trilogy still gets me sad fuck you sony,0
first peter parker was never the biggest nerd in the world until tobey mcguire he was never a loser he never had that kind of crush witj mj mj was like the prom queen but kirsten dunst made her become the prozac girl thats all raimi he crated these personas for the main characters now a lot of people think peter parker has to be an anti social nerd no he doesnt only when sam raimi is directing second movie works its an awesome movie dafoe is crazy good,0
i grew up with insert franchise here,1
it was a firefight not a spiderman quote but still willem dafoe is my shit,0
solid fukin review this film was my childhood love it,0
this was the first live action movie i saw,0
i hunch,0
i think maguire captures the looks of peter parker but andrew gave is the jokey spiderman character maguire was always like green goblin venom ock im gonna stop you before every battle and garfield would joke about it even when hes fighting they were solid goofs and gaffs too the thing i hate about garfield is that he looks like the sexiest man in the school he doesnt look nerdy as parker should but i think his spiderman performance out shadowed the peter parker not being nerdy,0
is it worth upgrading to blu ray k or are my blu rays fine,0
you re the man,0
i think this might have been the first movie i cried over as a kid my family went to see it for the second time and the tickets ended up being sold out i vividly remember my brother and i bawling out of disappointment,0
the thing that s surprising is that this is the only spider man film that went dark the fight scene for spider man was ok but it was too short the fight scene for spider man wasn t the best but spider man does get beat up by the sandman and venom and the fight scene for the amazing spider man wasn t special and the final fight scene for the amazing spider man was dramatic and slightly more entertaining than the fight scene from the first amazing spider man movie,0
i liked the amazing spider man and the amazing spiderman,0
thanks for doing this chris i just happened to have revisited this film myself just a few days ago and was reminded why i have such wonderful memories of it it really is one of the best superhero movies ever made exciting dramatic emotional wonderfully cast and tons of fun your review hit all the right points thanks,0
wish you would do a review of the spectacular spider man the animated series it s only a short series of two seasons and it s really good,1
does anyone know what in camera means,0
awesome review as always,0
hey chris stuckmann can you do a review for school of rock,1
this movie was alright peter parker was great mary jane was awful spiderman s fights felt fake and slow and spiderman did not joke around that much but in the end i still enjoy watching this movie,0
i think you still judged it with your heart in hand id give it a b at most but really a b we can just be loosely throwing a s around when there are so many comic book movies that are better this is just me being cold but i love spider man i also grew up with them,0
back to formula,0
this review is perfect it s everything i thought about the movie put into words,0
oh mr raimi you are a fucking brilliant director,0
spider man is a dick and asshole to the bad guys,0
those crushes suck man i feel you hate kirsten dunst though,0
did somebody say spoderman,0
do the shinning and a barrell roll,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man c,0
i must be the only person who likes this one a little more than spider man,0
excellent review i m astonished that you ve catched or rather paid attention to those tiny details like peter parker wearing the goblins colours and vice versa i love that you ve added videosegments of the scenes you talked about it really helps understanding and or remebering your point great job chris,0
i love you chris,0
great review chris i really did enjoy this movie it s fun silly and funny b for me,1
i want that tshirt it looks awesome,0
after watching the dissapointment that was amazing spider man i really needed to re watch the first spider man movies to remind me how good his movie used to be and re watching this movie again makes me feel like a year again back in because at that time spider man was my favorite marvel superhero next to batman for dc,0
i remember standing up and clapping at the end of this movie that s right i nerded out that much,0
i was four when i saw this movie for the first time and it s still one of my favorite movies,0
i enjoyed both amazing spider man movies fight me,0
did you ever see the japanese spider man it s some crazy stuff,0
are you going to do anymore videos with the flick pick,0
i m glad you still like it but for me it really didn t age well the comedy is cringeworthy there s absolutely no chemistry between tobey maguire and kirsten dunst tobey maguire is just so awkward as peter parker that it s just awkward for me as a viewer too and they really skipped the whole kid genius part apart from the you get an a scenes time to time kirsten dunst as mj is just a plot device not a real character willem dafoe is cheesily over the top i didn t give a crap about uncle ben because he was on screen for like minutes and he s just not human he s a freaking saint the action is meh at best by today s standards apart from a few scenes in the entire trilogy,1
i don t really see the similarity between power rangers suits and green goblin s suit i didn t like the organic shooters because i like the idea that he needs to recharge and reload web capsules or has issues when he runs out overall the film was great though,0
i actually loved that they changed it so he could actually shoot web through his wrists in this spidey universe thought it was a great idea,0
nice venom shirt,0
spider man next not tas,0
i love the tobey maguire spider man movies in my opinion the first two the dark knight trilogy including batman and the first two christopher reeve s superman movies are the holy trinity of superhero movies the superhero movies today just don t have any heart they are too manufactured,1
this spiderman movie is my favorite out of all of them everything you said in this video were spot on,0
give the that shirt,0
i never understood the accusations of these movies being cheesy emotional honesty is not cheese,1
dude i d love to hear your thoughts about the first two blade movies they re way too underappreciated in my opinion those started it all,0
do a war of the worlds review,0
i was about or when this movie came out and i loved it to death my experience was the same as yours when i saw the trailer for it i m hyped to hear your thoughts on spiderman the doc ock vs spiderman train scene still stands today as one of my favorite almost my most favorite superhero fight scenes ever,0
sorry chris but this movie does not hold up at all,0
great review chris never noticed the choice of attire in that dinner scene before,1
so chris was when this movie came out but watched the s tvshow chris stuckmann is a time lord confirmed,0
i personally find the amazing spider man movies slightly better than the originals i think andrew garfield is a better version of peter parker and there is better characterization for the lead roles idk just my opinion,0
i adore the old marvel films not the mcu,0
i guess i m sort of the guy that likes dark and gritty but with a touch of humor and i don t get why in this darn marble universe that we ve created now why superheroes have to fight each other shouldn t we be focusing on the enemy the same also applies to the dc universe but i can say i would rather see civil war than batman v superman if i get the chance to go see a movie i never turn it down unless i know it s going to be awful going in i m so happy that blind people can watch movies now because they decided to put them in descriptive audio just for us i used to wait until a movie came out on video just so that i wouldn t be a distraction for people in the movie theater unless it was a blockbuster but now the time is come to where i can really get into cinema just like you the only complaint that i have is that warner bros needs to get off their butts and start putting descriptive audio on their dvds so that we can enjoy them,0
the last fight scene with goblin and spidey was my fucking childhood thaty scene was so sick on so many levels,1
the first two spider man movies are just as good as any mcu movie to be honest,0
so glad you re doing this,0
this movie and spiderman was awesome,0
wow thank you chris you ve re opened my eyes as to why i originally loved this film as a kid thank you i m going to go re watch this film with friends and re live the nostalgia,0
i m evil i like spiderman i m so sorry,0
hey chris what happened to those shitty january movies kind of missing you rant,0
i did not like any of the spiderman films every single one of them with the exception of the first amazing spiderman i got so bored that i almost fell asleep which is not something i normally do at the movie theater but that s just my opinion i know i m probably going to get a lot of hate for it but i already know that going in,0
awesome review let s get some more retro reviews,0
one of my all time favorites and i m not even that much into superhero movies,0
this was the first comic book movie i ever saw,0
please do a tron and tron legacy review,0
million in one weekend how far we ve come,0
the struggle of having a crush spider man,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man d the amazing spider man d,0
yeaa chris do that every one,0
chris reviewing the spider man movies what a treat,0
i dont know if you ll see this chris but that final fight scene between green goblin and spider man the one you said was surprisingly brutal had to be toned down to give the movie a pg rating the first cut of the film received an r because of that fight thought you d find that pretty interesting great review,0
chris there s no such thing as an unnecessary rant especially since it was on point,0
most people have star wars i have spider man,0
spiderman has to get an a,0
yessss,0
that shirt is cool,0
are the guy on modern family,0
like it as a kid not now,0
wait is spiderman in the civil war movie,0
pizza time,0
wow i didn t even notice the dinner thing until now,0
the original spiderman movies are trash the amazing spiderman and are the best ever better than anything in mcu and star wars and sinster would have been an instant classic andrew garfield was the best evur and the new movies had better effects and looked like a video game,1
ok i have to disagree with you on mary jane i didn t hate the i hunch conversation but mj was waaaay too protagonist s girlfriend damsel in distress for me,0
this wasn t so bad i mean at least he didn t do some emo dance right lol,1
i swear tobey will always by my favorite spiderman because i he was the first superhero i ever seen in a movie and i loved it so much i had all the spiderman toys clothes shoes blankets ect you name it i was really upset they didn t continue on raimis saga,0
chris stuckmann bus driver could be the next speed i loved this movie since i was six when i came out i remember getting so excited when i saw the commercial for it on tv it s the only movie that i ve seen times at the theatre,0
this is my personal all time favorite film i m so glad to see that others have a legitimate fondness and love for it,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c tasm b tasm c,0
i died when he was trying to get his web to work xd,0
i remember i d always ask to get the special gloves that i assumed were real that spider man used to climb walls in the movies when i was a kid,0
the last scene in this movie is one of the best scenes in movie history,0
spiderman tasm spiderman tasm spiderman don t shoot me,1
in camera director captain,0
i loved the orignal spider mans so much that i would re enact the movie with my action figures scene for scene,0
since it has passed more than years since this movie came i consider it a superhero classic,0
i do miss the days when all comic book films didn t have to be so dark and gritty and they could be funny and campy sometimes,0
talk about or review the x files,1
spiderman b spiderman ii a spiderman iii c the amazing spiderman a the amazing spiderman ii b,1
yes,0
shocked how much i agree with you on this movie chris does spider man make as much jokes as he should maybe not but they re definitely there despite all of the complaints against this movie now because people think he never tells jokes he s not a good spider man he cries too much there are definitely issues with this one and spider man but it s a shame how much people dislike them now because they let the mess of spider man ruin the first two movies for them,0
finally the organic web shooters was a massive missed opportunity simply because the iconic web shooters was not just an ingenuity of peter s design but it also implemented the fact that peter parker is actually an extremely capable scientist engineer and overall genius in fact he s one of the smartest heroes in the marvel universe spider man had such potential for riveting science fiction since it has a rather significant aspect in his characterization because of the fact they actively skipped out on this you get a vague sense that peter is more of a dopey and humble nerd who s tough on his luck rather than the actual triumphant genius he is and it limits the understanding of his intelligence to nothing more than nerd talk instead of actively applying his talents to solve his problems alfred molina said it quite best using the line brilliant but lazy the look on peoples faces when i tell them that technically speaking spider man s iq is significantly higher than that of batman,0
chris stuckmann ha more like chris stuckmann,1
chris can you do a spider man game review for the ps,0
this was the first movie i ever watched two times in a theatre loved it,0
ironically i went and saw this in theaters and no one was there so odd lol,0
yeah i remember me my brothers going to the theaters all ready waiting for the movie at the time movie was everywhere remember dr pepper cans the movie still fun yeah i like music score for the theme even i like the james horner for first amazing spider man movie awesome review chris,0
yesss,0
please do a hilariocity review for birdemic,0
i don t care what nostalgia critic says i still think both of these movies are perfect,1
i used to be so scared of the green goblin in this movie,0
could you review the evil deads please,0
ive been waiting for thissssss,1
the moment where uncle ben is gasping for his breath and dies was the first time i really started crying watching a sad movie scene eveything before that were only one or two tears treambling down my cheek to this day it s only spider man and up that has made me actually start crying as hilarious as it may sound spider man did really effect me as a kid,1
one of the best superhero movies to this day,0
this was one of my favorite reviews of your s,0
spider man having organic web is more realistic than peter building his own web shooters oh chris but seriously the point of the web shooters in the original comic is to show that peter even if he didn t have that much resources was so smart that he could built them with whatever he had at hand if you gave peter the resources of tony stark he could have easily built the iron spider suit a decade before civil war,0
also regarding the quips its not the fact its not enough its more or less the fact given mcguire s earlier portrayal as the quiet parker as spider man they don t quite compliment the character it seems out of place not forced but when you have this kind of character contrast it feels almost as if peter uses his spider man persona as an outlet for the kind of crap he goes through as peter parker however they did this right with garfield to a t simply because as peter he s already such a spazz constantly his quips easily compliments his character because it acts as both psychological warfare and as a psychological coping mechanism because even early s comics peter was never a reserved person to the point he wouldn t be afraid to tell someone off people simply craped on him because he was an over achieving nerd not because he looked like an easy target,0
finally i ve been waiting for one of my favourite youtubers to review the spiderman trilogy as i m especially interested in an in depth reason why everyone hated spiderman sooo much,0
this movie made me love comics and movies and made me what i am today this is super nostalgic for me too,0
this movie was fun wasnt as good as the nd one in this trilogy that is all,0
you want me to meet your parents this relationship is moving kinda fast chris senpai,0
you mean like in the amazing spider man where spider man stops this car thief and disarms the cop,0
hey chris speaking of x files it s coming back this month what do you think of that,1
wrong super hero peter,0
isn t that what s known as a circlejerk,0
great review i always thought the green goblin suit was okay given how goofy the character is,0
i can t believe how old this trilogy has gotten it still feels like it came out just yesterday for me but people now refer to it from their childhood i m getting too old,0
you know how much i sacrificed,0
chris would look so cute wearing a diaper,1
i love the end fight scene it s filthy and bloody and primal slamming each other through walls and the grenade exploding in his face and how he bites his bloody lips as he s webbing osborn to the wall,0
the way you described the whole green goblin looks like a power ranger thing reminds me of how some guy said doomsday looks like a ninja turtle and then that caught on stupid people regurgitating other people s opinions that they read on the internet,0
the raimi films are really good i d even say is good definitely nowhere near or but not as bad as people say and much better than the tasm crapfests,1
you should watch review the boondock saints favourite film and would love to see your take on it,0
admittedly i don t know too much about spiderman i played spiderman and ultimate also the bad one which shall not be named and watched all the moves but in my opinion toby is the best peter parker he is the most well rounded nerdy guy you can see him develop etc but amazing spider man guy it s his offical name now is the better spider man he s the cool funny masked hero doing all of them backflips he nailed the mid life spiderman after he figured out his powers between the two toby was the best and most well rounded but each had there advantages,0
and thank you chris i needed to hear that d,1
i want that shirt where did you get it,0
dr octogonapus bahhhh,0
this one really is my favorite out of all of the spider man movies and those green goblin scenes always scare me i feel so sorry for peter i love it,0
doug walker nostalgia critic and john campea collider movie talk better watch this review chris you are the best and always be my hero sam raimi s spider man all the way,1
i think the homophobic joke wouldnt fly in todays family films and thats good it was in poor taste,0
i highly recommend the outtakes gag reel from this willem dafoe and jk simmons will have you in stitches,0
regarding toby mcguire being the best spiderman i believe peoples interpretation of what spiderman is subjective and based on time period i was in high school when asm and asm came out and it was realistic that is how a modern day peter parker would be and act while spiderman peter would be a campy s spiderman which is fine,0
spiderman was the first superhero i ever saw i would crawl around in bushes and put my hand under the doormat hoping a spider would bite me and give me spider powers,0
looking back on this film i generally like the casting and honestly some of the feel good moments where the cast really shines even in the goofy part but as i got older i realized the reason why i like spider man is not really because of the relatable nerdy character living every comic book nerd fantasy but really how its a tale about an incredibly talented person who becomes gifted with powers and decides how to use them and live his life responsibly with such a burden especially when come face to face with overwhelming odds while spider man is an insanely cool character its ultimately peter parker you come to respect and idolize which is what distinctively separates him from other dual identity heroes like batman or superman while i like mcguire s performance as parker the character himself is really not much more than a cliche nerd gets the girl trope everyone s general harsh treatment towards him seem weirdly outdated and out of place simply making it kinda hard to relate or take seriously at times which sort of tone just carried itself throughout the series especially when it attempted a more serious approach in and i e the dance scene,0
that venom shirt is fucking epic i want it,0
i saw this movie in the theaters times back when i was years old i ll always love the toby mcguire spider man trilogy,0
we already got a good marvel film before spider man and x men blade,0
danny elfman s spider man theme really captured how heroic and deep spider man is,0
this movie is such a classic great review,1
loved this movie,0
yeah the suit is kind of power ranger villain kind of thing now that you mention it but honestly when i saw it for the first time my thoughts were thank god they didn t went for that silly comics outfit seriously it could ve been a lot worse like either silly s comic book worse or you know like dane dehaan face herpes worse there is no good way to adapt the green goblin in a way everyone will like it that s because he s too much of a comic book villain,0
kristen dunst been there,0
i had hoped the original teaser trailer would have been discussed it was cut from the movie because it depicted the twin towers,0
this movie is really dated in my opinion,0
chris when you review spider man i hope you talk about the the telecast scene where peter takes out his original suit and looks at it realizing all the wrong he has done,0
this is one of my favorite movies of all time yes,1
the first spider man is the best one looking forward to your future reviews,0
danny elfman s score and raimi s direction in this trilogy created the best spider man ever you can really understand all the characters and the choices they make these movies are also unlike all other super hero movies today where it s basically the same formula hell even spider man was pretty good probably my favorite scene in the entire trilogy is in spider man when after going through all the tough shit with the symbiote school work mj aunt may and harry peter finally takes out his original suit and looks it coupled with danny elfman s beautiful telecast ost that scene was amazing you really got to see that peter understood all the wrong he has done and who he really is,0
such a good point about the web d,0
chris i saw you are doing reviews of old movies leading up to the new release so i will be watching with you before watching your reviews,0
please tell me you will be doing a reaction to the oscar nominations,0
what is the intro song,0
jk simmons is just the best at anything,0
i can t wait for chris to do a review on spider man i would really like to know how he reacted to watching the scene where peter is dancing in the coffee shop for the first time and the other scene when peter is walking down a sidewalk and is doing a weird evil cool dance hahahahahahahahahahahaha i love that scene,0
review memento and the prestige,0
i agree if spider man is too cheeky with his jokes it takes you out of the scene,0
i agree with every word you said,0
spider man is one of my favorite superhero movies i think it hits all beats that a superhero movies should hit,1
yes tobey fit the part better as you mentioned he captures the nerdiness of peter parker but garfield was good too maybe too good looking for the part i don t know amazing spiderman itself being not as good is another deal in regards of couple chemistry garfield and stone were better i think dafoe was great as the green goblin yes his suit was awful though and one more thing as much as i like raimi and the evil dead series that fight scens at the end of this movie was way too silly for me i do think this was a good movie though i enjoyed the nd one more,0
i loved this movie and maguire as spider man you made me feel nostalgic and want to watch it again,0
all i know is i really prefered andrew garfield in the role he was perfect he s a better actor overall too which helps,0
one of my favorite films of all time,0
best spider man movie,1
noooo james horner he did some of my favourite movie scores especially the ones from my childhood such as balto,0
you should do this with all batman and superman movies until batman v superman hahahaha,0
wait hans zimmer did spider man music,0
you think peter is too poor to create web shooters yet he apparently had enough money to make an entire suit not to mention the house he lives in isn t a poor persons house,1
i ve seen this movie more than a dozen times and i never noticed the colors thing during the dinner scene pretty cool,0
when i was a kid i used to watch the same movies like once a week and spider man was one of them this movie was so important to me as a kid lmao i loved it so much i still remember seeing spider man in theaters and being so heartbroken because it was nothing like the spider man i loved i obviously see how cheesy the movie are now but i still always enjoyed them and you talking about all the good qualities of the movie reminded me how much i used to love it,0
definitely one of the great comic book films even more so because of where the genre was at the time it was one of the first times a studio made a real effort instead of a cheap niche film even if i was never thrilled with the goblin look it has so many memorable moments that still define the character for me and that ending with mary jane was so perfectly unexpected i remember my jaw dropped in a good way they completely stuck the landing,0
review now,0
chris worked with handicapped children that s awesome,0
still my fav spiderman movie andrew garfield in amazing spiderman,0
my biggest complaint with these superhero movies are that villians have the least amount of screen time fuck the love story fuck his aunt and uncle fuck the school scenes i don t mind the newspaper scenes but everything should be implied and just tell a superhero vs villian story,0
i never thought of that the goblin a power ranger rip off kinda is this was easily the best spiderman series,0
i like the amazing spider man better than toby maguire,0
thanks for this video looking forward to you reviewing the rest of the spider man films,0
spiderman was so good,0
every point you raised had me like meg ryan in when harry met sally but seriously chris thanks good to hear from a well respected reviewer that they do appreciate how fun well made and entertaining the original raimi movies were,0
go web fly a pa pa paraweeweb shazam,0
this movie introduced me to spider man,0
ah of my favorite marvel films beaten only by spider man not tasm avengers n winter soldier,0
i ve been saying tobey is the better spiderman out of him and andrew for a while so i m glad to see that you agree he s great chris too many people say he s worse simply because of the emo phase he went through in spiderman that doen t wipe his amazing performances in the past films guys,0
spider man will forever be a classic,0
the prestige review in honour of bowie please chris baby,0
chris stuckmann in each of your videos you have this way of making us want to go the theatre i respect you immensely for that the physical experience of going to the movies is so important i hope it will last thank you ps i laughed a lot during this video,0
chris you should watch the spectacular spider man tv series it s the best adaptation of spider man,0
nice review agree with everything spidey by sam raimi are definitely in the top of the superhero movies out there so far i was when spidey came out my dad bought me a mouse pad for my then new computer that had a art rendition of the new spider man on it still have it still use it spider man is my favorite superhero movie can t wait to hear your thoughts,0
my favorite film of all time loved it when i was a kid still do being reviewed by my favorite film reviewer life is good,0
j k simmons is j jonah jameson he needs to return for the mcu spider man movies,0
i love these long throwback reviews,0
i did the same on my stairs those were good times,0
the amazing spider man movies are so trash can t even compare with spider man,1
i always liked how they made new york look like a character of its own and how big it is,0
in spite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you,0
are you going to review the trilogy chris,0
my favourite cbm ever,0
you are literally the best person on the internet,0
personally i felt that spider man was way to cheesy to receive this much praise yes i understand that it was supposed to be that comic book corniness but so many scenes are just so over the top that i felt uncomfortable watching them even as a kid is that just me,0
this movie was one of my favorite movies and first movies i seen this when was and still to this day i love the character of spiderman,0
i really hate the mary jane character in just this first movie she is with flash thompson harry osborn spiderman and peter parker she doesn t know they are the same in one word slot xd,0
what the fuck is wrong with venom s jaw,0
hey chris did you know that ralph bakshi wizards lord of the rings worked on the s spider man show,0
i know that s not the point of this video chris but i would have loved to have heard at least some of those minor flaws and nit picks that you did find in the movie,0
this movie was my childhood,0
why does people hate spiderman,0
none of chris videos will load why is that,0
never heard of green goblin being a like a power ranger until now,0
i like that chris is reviewing older films specially now that not many good movies are to be released in the next few months,0
i love this review so much passionate one,0
spider man yeah d,0
spectacular spiderman cartoon is the best spidey cartoon,1
i think it disserves a plain a but that s just me,0
great movie i remember goint to movie in i was blown away later i rewatch it like times still great movie tobey is peter,1
hey stuckmann is the k master of the film noticeable as compared to regular blu ray,0
i feel like web shooters are just a plot device for the comics every week oh no he ran out of web,0
still my most favorite superhero movie,0
i ve loved spiderman when i was a really little kid before star wars well this was it so my list here is pretty damn nostalgic spiderman a spiderman a my favorite comic book movie until i saw captain america winter soldier and dark knight spiderman b i saw it when it came out when i was holy shit the amazing spiderman c ok the amazing spiderman d an absolute mess and the only spiderman movie which made me very bored,0
bone saw is ready rip macho man,0
when chris mentioned platoon i was going to correct him reminding him that it s splatoon then i remembered that there was a movie that actual people who leave their basements saw so i stopped,0
am i the only one who loved spiderman,0
you know what would be interesting after you re done all the spidey reviews to go back and review hulk it would be cool to hear your thoughts on that i think danny elfman s score for that is just as good as for spider man imo and the camerawork and transitions are pretty cool in comparison to comic book movies today,0
what i really want to know is what franchise did chris not grow up loving,0
spider man is the best superhero movie for me,1
the raimi movies are god awful just stupid and cheesy new ones are way better,0
wow perfect timing chris i just recently watched this movie again and i agreed with everything you said one thing i noticed i don t know if this was done on purpose or not is that all the sam raimi spider man films have kinda of a symbolic meaning to them ex spider man spidey has to confront and overcome greed green goblin spider man spidey has to make choices and sacrifice for good and not let pride doc ock overwhelm him spider man this is an obvious one spidey fights guilt and his inner demons venom i realized this after watching sm and thought more deeply about the films your thoughts anyways great review hope you see this anything anyone wants to add let me know,0
thank you for your insight i just noticed so many little gems about this movies that i hadn t before great review as always,0
chris are you saying you dont like spin offs cliff hangers and set ups on other universes or are u nit picking,0
i hate toby maguire lol it s funny to see chris think he s the best as i couldn t stand anything about him dafoe definitely was good for the role but man that suit is awful lol not that i think green goblin has ever been a particularly great looking character but this suit is meh not that i know what the best outcome of that should ve been,0
april the day we get to see spidey interact with an avenger,0
anyone watched japanease spiderman its amazing i think its still on marvel com,0
i hope the new spiderman is funny without being forced awkward,0
i grew up with these and not the original star wars so i don t love them as much as other so these harry potter and the lord of the rings are the biggest nostalgia films for me also as a side not i looooooooove the main theme in spider man,1
ok chris i gotcha,0
i love the green goblin suit honestly there was no way they couldn t make it look a little silly,0
this was the first film i ever saw on a pirate dvd it was awesome because the quality was perfect and i got to see it a week before it was out in theatres,0
spiderman is the best super hero,0
sam remi didn t an excellent job peter parker was a real character who had conflict and we could care for,0
i love spider man and is eh because of its comic book style i think these are some of the only comic book films that actually feel like comic books i love the mcu but let s be honest they don t really have a huge comic book feel maybe i m wrong i don t read too many comics tasm and i felt were so unnecessary and they tried to do the whole more serious thing and imo failed and i don t care what anyone says tobey maguire andrew garfield,0
yay he read my comment,0
that s a sony movie chris marvel studios makes marvel movies,0
i m a dc fan and love all the movies they had in the old times even marvel had some movies that never caught my attention but when spider man came out it became the very first marvel movie i felt in love and had so much fun watching it i watch it more than any other movie i have watched to the point i act every scene out of it i even did tricks and climbing walls because of this movie this movie always hold a special place in my heart,0
kirsten dunst sucks as mj mj was a damsel in distress in every movie hey had no chemistry emma stone s gwen stacy was better i wish hey got a better look for the goblin,0
sir ur wife is on line picks up phone and hangs up,0
haha yea i m still not a fan of this movie at all but i respect your opinion all the same stuckman thanks,0
have you considered doing a similar series where you review every harry potter movie leading up to fantastic beasts,0
spiderman and spiderman are both great movies they helped usher in all the awesome superhero movie of today piggybacking on the success of x men,0
you said that it was illogical that a poor high school kid wouldn t be able to make the web shooters but what about his suit that doesn t look like something he could make with regular fabrics,0
always found that tobey and kirstens line delivery was so really hokie and kinda bad that really but me off,0
honestly the final fight between spider man and the green goblin may be my favourite fight in a movie ever,0
i agreed with you fully on this such a great movie the new one doesn t hold a candle to it,0
in spite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you,0
actually in the scene where tobey is climbing up a wall he s all wired up and really is scaling the wall,0
spider man best superhero movie all time,0
i loved that movie so much when it came out thank you for the review,0
i m so nostalgic for this movie,0
throw everything away and do all of the spider man films,0
i remember this movie as a kid i fucking loved it,0
i actually preffer a more jockey spiderman to me the character has a moment in marvel zombies when he said that the jokes are for keeping himself in calm because he is so afraid that he wants the people to think that it s easy for him that he can even fight while he is joking around the suit of green gobling its goofy but never makes the movie better or worse to me i love this movie and i hope the others videos,0
i loved this review really made me remember how much this film means to me excellent work chris,0
so are you going to do a retrospective of spider man in film before the mcu reboot comes out,0
spider man and are not only my favorite comic book movies but they rank among my favorite movies period especially spider man i don t care what anyone else says and hey guess what i even enjoy spider man even if it s a huge downgrade from the first two movies the sam raimi spider man movies are important to me as both a hardcore spider man fan and as a movie fan i ve always loved movies but watching the first spider man movie as a teenager back in opened my eyes to so many more movies and it made me appreciate all types of film making to this day watching the first spider man movie is and always will be my all time favorite movie theater experience,0
i rewatched this the other night knowing you were gonna do a review and you re spot on about how it still holds up love this film,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman c tasm c tasm d spiderman s grade raised for me after watching tasm spiderman would have actually been great if raimi was allowed to just have only the sandman as a villian,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c to generous the amazing spiderman a the amazing spider man b pretty big fan if i can say so myself,0
raimi killed it with sm i never noticed the color thing with the alter egos clothes but i have always loved the brutal fight btn gg and sm raimi incorporated some of his dark horror sensibilites into it,0
now this guy i like he doesn t hate spider man because other people say it is and he explains points that are so true that it proves why,0
i ve always thought tobey maguire as peter parker was damn near perfect i personally can t stand the newer actor who plays parker chris made a great point in how when a superhero has too many joke lines he just comes off as dickhead or an asshole,0
whoa never noticed that with the colors,0
i thought spidey s quips were done perfectly in the raimi movies in the comics he says something in every panel and while it works there that would be the most annoying thing in the movies raimi handled it perfectly and didn t make spider man annoying he didn t make many jokes but when he did they were hilarious and most importantly raimi s spider man knew when shit got real and was able to cast aside his playfulness if things got serious,0
i m glad to hear the praise for tobey maguire as spider man when the movie came out i felt like i was the only one who liked his performance and portrayal,0
funny chris was in im now not really weird but curious,0
i really love these classic reviews chris this movie was a large part of my childhood i for one feel a lot of nostalgia for the superhero movies of the s because it was a time when they didn t need to be franchised they were a novelty and the ones that hit were amazing films i enjoy all the comic book movies today but the market is getting a bit saturated here s hoping dc can bring a breath of fresh air to it all,0
even though i think tom holland will be a great spider man for the mcu i still think tobey will always be spidey,0
most comic book movies now are obsessed with being dark and sad what marvel has put out movies and none of them are dark and sad that criticism of the genre is ridiculously offbase,0
mr stuckmann i have so much respect for you as you have pursued your passion for film i just wanted to thank you for reviewing these movies as i was a kid who grew up in the early s spider man defined me as a person and ignited my love for movie thanks man,0
how great is the moment where jonah rescues peter by telling the goblin he doesn t know who takes spider man photos great character moment,0
can u do legend,0
i grew up with this movie and it is a well done movie but this is definitely too much praise for it some scenes look very dated imo some effects and some stunts and i really don t like how spiderman is that bulky he should be a skinny agile type and i know amazing spiderman will get a lot of hate from chris in another video but it doesn t deserve it either both movies have their pros and cons and they are pretty much on the same level imo,0
shut up chris you re showing your face too much in this review i need more pictures of spider man p s the caps is the only way i can do yelling j k simmons justice,0
perfect casting is right aunt may looked and acted exactly how i imagined her from the comics,0
i just love how chris look into movies,0
hi chris i m and find myself in the same place as u said u were as a teenager where i want to learn more about movies and film being a critic would be amazing i know journalism is probably something that would be good but i was wondering what other things i could do to help get me to where i want to be if u see this a quick little response would be great thanks,1
great review,0
i agree with the quips in this movie it s not over done by any means it seems like how a geeky kid with a newfound confidence would act,0
yeah great film i remember seeing it myself in theater back in good memories,0
spiderman is one of the best superhero movies relatable villain hero s personal dilemma and superb action sequences,0
thank you so much chris this movie was huge to me growing up it was one of my first movies ever and i loved every second of it when i was younger it s one of those movies that makes me glad i got into film criticism and analysis because i get to look back on it with more depth and appreciation than yeah it s still good this movie pretty much nailed everything it went for great casting writing performances cinematography all around solid it had everything and now i can love it even more thanks,0
amen to the music,0
spiderman are without a doubt the two most under appreciated comic book movies of all time i actually get offended on a personal level when someone says that andrew garfield was better a better spiderman peter parker these are two of my favorite movies ever they have that movie magic that only a handful of comic book movies nowadays have spiderman is definitely one of the top greatest comic book films and the first one is also one of the top they nailed everything the casting the look the tone the action scenes and the villains,0
can t wait for jon watts mcu spider man reboot,0
i actually like the amazing spider man more than spider man and spider man but not by much and spider man was a movie,0
i enjoyed this film i don t love it it was a huge part of my early s childhood and i used to play this movie a lot on dvd i noticed a lot of flaws re watching it now but it s still a nostalgic film for me i was spiderman for halloween back in when i first watched this film and i use to have a spiderman and green goblin walkie talkie the film doesn t really holds up to me though but that doesn t mean the movie is not good because it s pretty darn good,0
yes finally i ve waited for this review for so long,1
i really love the first spider man movie i love seeing spider man web swinging the action scenes peter parker and how he deals with his issues hearing the music and much more spider man and spider man are one of my favorite movies of all time,0
hahaha d he is right and that face expression and sound he makes is so funny d,0
andrew garfield is a great actor and did a good job as parker but to me tobey maguire was the perfect representation of young peter from the comics garfield was clearly not a geeky uncomfortable misfit like maguire was lots of people crap on dunst as mj but i always thought she was great raimi s spider man is a better movie and still one of the very best superhero films ever but the first spider man is a really good first theatrical outing,0
i have such incredible amounts of nostalgia for this movie i still remember there was an entire week in kindergarten after i saw it where i wore the full spider man outfit under my clothes with the mask in my pocket couldn t use the bathroom at all but man there was nothing better than running around the playground and ripping my shirt off in front of people to show off the spider man costume watching the movie now i have to agree i think it s still a great film seeing peter learn to swing for the first time when he s chasing uncle ben s killer mixed with the elfman score just gives me the chills,0
big fan of yours as well as the schmoes and collider i know john campea often mentions kristen dunst being miscast as mary jane as one of the biggest miscasts of the last years or so do you think she was right for the part who else at that time would have been good as mary jane watson,0
could you do a review of the godfather wasn t able to find it,0
one of the best superhero films ever the perfect spiderman origin story,0
spiderman sucks bitch,0
spider man b spider man a spider man d the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man b,1
it would be sooo awesome if they got j k simmons for jameson in the new reboot,0
spiderman c spiderman b spiderman d the amazing spiderman b the amazing spiderman d,0
yes when marvel kept things simple the marvel universe is just disney s way of creating a machine that makes money,0
out of every marvel movie that s been made i ve for sure seen this one way more than any other sure it s cheesy but god damn it s nostalgic,0
on point with that intro comic book movies back then where fun interpretations and not some movie with forced cameo or cramming in other heroes for the sake of building up future movies,0
this was one of my most anticipated movies ever i was so hyped for it as a kid and saw it three or four times in theaters awesome review chris you reminded me why i loved that movie so much can t wait to for the spider man video,0
its like am in my country still watching stuckmann,0
defoe really didn t even need the green goblin mask he could ve worn a hoodie and the face he made at in this video is convincing enough for me anyways one of the best superhero movies ever made,0
there are a few points i don t agree with at all in this review such as when it was said that peter should have organic web shooters instead of real mechanical ones since it s more realistic and this is coming from the guy who said previously that you re talking about a guy who gets bitten by a spider and can climb up walls and fight crime pretty sure realism is out the window at this point and my qualms about the organic web shooters is that it completely downplays peter s intelligence i mean in the raimi films you just look at peter and assume he s smart cause he wears glasses is unconfident and acts like a nerd when he really comes off as a geek and doesn t prove his intelligence at all however in the comics and even in the tv show you know peter is a freaking genius he s not reed richards level but he s a pretty good scientist he was top of his class in fact there were so many instances in the comics as well as the animated series where he got out of shit just by using science and his brain having peter build his own web shooters shows how much of a genius he is a normal high school student can t build anything like that but peter isn t just a normal high school student who gets up for school and does his homework every once in a while that s what i really loved about the marc webb films even though they weren t perfect you still see how smart peter is organic web shooters just take that and a good part of the comic book away also peter is always known for his jokes and fast quips i m fine with those two jokes in the movie but what i m not fine with is that they re probably the only two he uses on villains in the entire trilogy if you ve read a spider man comic book you know he uses his humor as part of his defensive strategy i guess cause when you re smaller compared to an iron giant it helps using humor to make the big seem not so big that s what spider man does that s who he is if you say two jokes per movie or worse two or three jokes per trilogy is good then do you even have an accurate representation of who spider man is yeah he s cheesy yeah he s a shy teenager but a main part of his personality and why people love him so much is because of his fast quips there is a line i admit between sounding like an asshole and being able to deliver a few fast quips i think tasm not the tasm did a better job at capturing spider man for who he is granted i still don t think either movie has gotten the perfect spider man yet i m hoping tom holland can do that and while i still do love the original spider man people need to stop praising it as the greatest film ever cause it most definitely was not,1
chris comic book movies back then weren t all silly we also had a ton of serious ones like daredevil and ughhhh catwoman,0
yes i didn t know you were making this chris spiderman is my favorite superhero and the original trilogy are my favorite movies thank you for reviewing them,0
unfortunately spider man has aged badly for me especially since the mcu began i can t even watch it anymore because it s become too corny,0
spider man d spider man b spider man c the amazing spider man d the amazing spider man e,0
i love this movie to bits and spiderman as well spiderman i remember enjoying as a little kid but now i can just get through it i honestly can t wait to see how tom holland is going to do as spiderman in civil war i for one think he s gonna own it but for me my spiderman will always be tobey macguire great review as always chris,0
man i ve always loved spider man ever since people heard about the reboot they ve been talking so much shit about this trilogy that it has made my heart ache i m so happy about this video edit also chris i m really impressed i ve noticed that whenever you announce that something s coming soon you really do get to it and release it on time i ve caught myself thinking is he already done with that all the time not a lot of people do that nowadays i salute you,0
i like this movie but for some reason i just don t like tobey maguire and i can t really explain it,0
yes,0
when tobey maguire says to elizabeth bak s character i m peter parker i m a photographer fucking lost it at scene never got that as a kid,0
notice me chris i beg ya,1
does anyone know what chris s yt group is called,0
when i received the notification for this review my childhood grew afraid,0
i think it was the first big movie after and we were in need of a superhero movie,0
i really can t believe this movie almost years old i was when i saw it and i m now it absolutely me away sure it s campy cheesy and silly but back then it was like citizen kane to year old me,0
are marvel movies gritty at all there s more goofy funny superhero movies out there than gritty ones,0
being years old and having the crippling crush and feeling the connection with peter parker totally with you chris,0
i love the first two films in the original spider man series they re just so action packed fun and emotional at the same time d,0
admit it stuckmann you only did this review as an excuse to show of that t shirt it does look awesome though,0
cool though wasn t there a spider man film from,0
you gonna review the xmen movies,0
japanese spiderman inspired power rangers look that up it need to be a review like star wars holiday spacial,0
man i still watch it good movie til this day sam gets the character spiderman and nailed it,0
i think topher grace could of done a good spider man but i mean it s cool the made him eddie but he would of been a good spidey,0
this movie,0
chris how much shirts do you have i have like that s it,0
spiderman is probably my first or second favorite comic book movie,0
im not an amazing spider man fan but andre garfield n my opinion is the best spider man to date and i dont really think anyones going to top that i dont think toby mcguires a good actor either,0
wait a minute is that joe manganiello as flash thomson holy shit,0
yeaah this and spiderman shit on asm and,0
reasons why the amazing spider man is sooooo much better than the original spider man trilogy gwen stacey is more interesting than mary jane in every way tobey maguire s peter parker never evolved as a character and quit being spider man because of the stress of the job andrew garfield s peter parker evolves as a character andrew garfield is funnier than tobey maguire the villains actors took their roles much more seriously than the ones in the original looking at you dafoe the chemistry between gwen stacey and peter parker is not only believable but adorable the action is awesome the police actually contribute they even manage to corner the lizard and capture spider man for a short time the best stan lee cameo ever andrew garfield is better at playing the cocky over confident guy that spider man was maguire cried too much and acted too much like a dufus emo peter parker in spider man the dance scene in spider man,0
this is my favorite movie of all time so thank you for this review,0
a lot of this movie had to be change after the attacks there s a banned poster featuring the twin towers reflected in spider man s lense there s even a teaser here on youtube that was pulled from theaters because there was a huge web spun between the towers in fact the original ending was suppose to take place on the wtc,0
in all honestly chris i do disagree about the quips it didn t feel balanced but i will say this is the only raimi film he made the most jokes quips on with spider man he needs to be more quipy under the mask because like mj when that mask is on he is a different person it s to show he isn t afraid of his villains even though he is and to also get them frustrated to the point they screw up,0
you should review all harry potter films before fantastic beasts comes out,0
great film great review fair a score,0
you spoiled uncle ben s death kappa,0
i agree with a lot of your points however i could have used a bit more quips i m not a fan of organic web shooters i didn t like kirsten d as mary jane though i don t think you mentioned your opinion of k d anyways spider man have been the best so far,0
after this review i need to watch it again,0
the green goblin was supposed to look completely different animatronics i heard the reason for the change was that the original look was too scary for children so they change it into the green goblin power ranger the youtube channel studioadi has videos on what the green goblin was supposed to look like,1
this is why i love chris s reviews he just really understands movies and what they should be and can appreciate them for what they are spider man and are some of the best comic book movies and tobey maguire was an amazing spiderman,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man c,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man d,0
love this surprise review but can i please get the attack on titan review pretty please,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man b i actually really enjoyed the amazing spider man electro was an interesting character i thought the lizard in the first one was awful,0
can t wait for spider man review my favorite comic book movie ever,0
one of my favorite superhero films third or fourth to only spider man and x then maybe winter soldier or batman begins the first movie i remember watching good review chris,0
holy shit nailed it that s exactly what happened with bale s batman voice,0
i m alread hyped for spiderman review lmao the dance scene,0
in you can t really make a nerdy peter parker cause nerds are considered hipsters and a bit cool now,1
there was social media back then just not facebook and todays stuff,0
i personally love spider man more than spider man,0
will he be reviewing all of them even though he already did the amazing spider man movies,0
i love this film so much d one of my favourite comic book films of all time the film was near enough a comic but in movement,0
spider man was just amazing such a good movie i actually liked more than plz no hate granted it borrowed a lot from the other two and venom was rushed as sh t but i loved sand man and his storyline if they hadn t included the street dancing scene and set up venom much more with a different actor it would easily be up there with the best,0
dude i love your review i feel the same way about this movie and all my friends hate on me for loving this one so much,0
i don t personally like any of the spiderman movies i think the best ones are mediocre at best i can t stand any of them,0
the only reason people ever say garfield is the better spider man is he joked first off tobey also joked second the humour in tasm is all wrong raimis films didn t have much joking but as a big fan he understands the character and knows that spidey is known for really cheesy one liners andrews version was a completely different type of humour they went for the type of rambling immature humour in the ultimate spider man comics whereas sam raimi stuck to the original amazing spider man comics type of humour with ridiculous quips and cheesy one liners i m not saying the type of humour in the ultimate comics is bad compared to the original amazing comics and the only reason the rambling immature humour worked in the ultimate comics was because peter was a kid garfield was a year old man acting like a kid the raimi spectacular show and original comics version is about a boy becoming a man the reason people hate garfield is because he was a man refusing to grow up,0
as a fan of the ultimate spider man comics i prefer the amazing spider man films the raimi trilogy just felt too corny and flat it felt like parody it was more like watching what joel shumacher would have done with spider man rather than an actual attempt at making good films if you look at the asm films next to the s version of the comics sure they re not very faithful but if you re a fan of ultimate spider man such as myself they were largely the spider man films you were looking for there were missteps sure but fewer in my opinion than in the raimi trilogy which i feel was entirely a misstep,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman d amazing spiderman b amazing spiderman c,0
i will never understand why people like spiderman it s so bad,0
woop woop,0
omg it was packed i went with my gf now wife in high school and we sat off to the far right and had to turn our heads and look up to see the movie they wouldn t let us change our tickets for a later showing either lol,0
spider man and rocked was okay it suffered from villain origin story creep amazing spider man was great haven t seen the last one,0
loved spiderman when it came out i was at the time and he was and still is my fave super hero i liked the movie i really liked the soundtrack i still hear the track hero these days dafoe was awesome like most of the cast but i like garfield as spidey parker better too bad his movies script was crap,1
i liked tobey as peter but as a teenager in highschool nah,0
very good characters and character development but the special effects are so so and i never ever liked that fact that he didn t design his web shooters probably my number one gripe with this spidey trilogy,0
sm a sm a sm c asm b asm d,0
i would ve enjoyed more quips but also the reason spider man just make his witty remarks to his enemies is to through them off their game and force them to make a mistake still love the movie,0
wait uncle ben dies,1
if it wasn t for sam raimi s spider man trilogy we wouldn t have all the elements that make the marvel cinematic universe work as well as it does,1
while i really didn t like the new amazing spider man films i think andrew garfield captured the quick wit and goofiness of spider man more so than toby but ya toby portrayed the more reserved moments well,0
yes yes yes yes yesssssss,0
silva war new james bond movie,0
nailed it mcguire was a far better peter than garfield was garfield s spidey was better though hopefully tom holland can pull off both roles,0
nah colby islam spiderman was astonishing,0
nah colby islam spiderman was astonishing,0
it s a shame so many people overlook this trilogy great films,0
i was five when i watched this,0
back when comic book movies weren t worn out,0
as a kid i loved spider man and i was disappointed with because my favorite villain venom was just terrible in the movie years later i re watched spider man and i couldn t get through it tobey maguire was terrible as spiderman he was a winy bitch so was andrew garfield but i felt more connected to andrew garfield than i did with tobey spiderman i have the same problem with i can t watch it like i use to be able too i personally like the amazing spider man more but they are far from the greatest movies for spiderman didn t like gwen stacy but i was more excited for the sinister six movie that asm set up rather than asm just my thoughts now lets see how many people hate my opinion,0
i was not a fan of kirsten s mj she wasn t spunky enough,0
great review this movie is so much better than most of the last marvel movies it has a perfect balance between fun and darkness i think cant wait for the next spiderman review excuse my poor english im not from usa,0
do harry potter reviews leading up to fantastic beasts and where to find them,1
if they removed the love interests these movies would all be really good but with those in there they made the nd acts whiny full of pointless angst and the rd acts repetitive,0
chris please tell me you watched the spectacular spiderman cartoon best spidey incarnation ever,1
love this movie by far the best of the spider man films also chris will you be reviewing a spidey film every month leading up to civil war like your star wars reviews,0
chris stuckmann i loved this movie when i was i was always afraid of the spider scene,0
great review chris,0
thanks to sony for destroying any future to this awesome series spider man were great movies and had so much potential to be possibly the best but it was rushed and its obvious it wasn t made with the passion of the first i don t know if there will ever be a better spider man series the amazing spider man movies were awful i hope someone builds a time machine so they can go and ensure the future of this series lol great review chris,0
k simmons for new spider man movie,0
i ll never understand the hate that the amazing spider man movies get i loved andrew as spider man and the chemistry between andrew and emma was so much more believable than the complete lack of sparks between tobey and kirsten i still love the originals aside from of course but the amazing spider man movies have a lot to love about them none of them are perfect and yes the studio interference in tasm was very noticeable but i still enjoyed the movie the tower scene at the end was probably the best scene in any of the spider man films,0
yasss a spiderman review how long i have waited,0
this movie made me love spider man at that time i was like years old it was awesome well made and full of heart now i can imitate norman s little speeches and laugh like the green goblin and freak out my girlfriend every time i do so d i can send it to you if you want it bad enough d,0
and good amazing spider man trash movies,0
i didn t mind the green goblins costume at first but than i saw the other concept for the costume and i changed my mind mostly because it s so much creepier as well as closer to the comics,0
plus spider man is underrated too sure venom is highly unnecessary and raimi didn t actually want venom in it emo peter is awkward that part is just bad but when you look at the sandman part of the movie it was fucking amazing,0
sooo no spectacular spider man,0
dat shirt,0
mmm love it chris you re a beacon of light in an abyss full of angry nerds thank you,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b the amazing spider man c the amazing spiderman c,0
this and the dark knight are easily my favorite comic movies anyways please do a hilariosity review on spiderman,0
mr stuckman please do an honorable mention to the japanese completely power rangerized live action spider man series in your next video,0
oh yes the ol good spiderman days can t wait for the next review spiderman has to be one of my top comic book movies ever,0
spider man will probably get an a or even an a it s great anyway spider man and ant man are the two things that get me really excited for civil war,0
ehhhh i still prefer the amazing spider man movies opposed to these ones the cheesy ness of it all just got to be too much with them the acting i didnt feel was very strong and it just didnt feel like spider man,0
personally i don t think this movie have aged as well as it could have the cgi used have not aged well some of the dialog can be dumb or silly at times here and there like the romantic dialog can be rather painful at times not just from peter but from mj as well mary jane as a character is okay in this movie however in the future movies she becomes less interesting and more of a thing that spider man have to save spider man also seems to go right back to square one at every movie and feel like he doesn t focus on the right things like when a new villain shows up he seems more focused on the bills rather then this new guy who can kill him he is suppose to be smart after all he is a geek it was one of the reasons they made him build the webshooters in the comics was to show how smart he was and what he could do with very limited resources toby s spider man however never seems to use his intelligence to outsmart the villains or solve problems related to his superhero persona still a good movie but it s still has some flaws here and there because of it being of the first successful comic book from which the formula and writing haven t been perfected yet,0
i will say i am one of the few who disliked these movies and preferred amazing spider man,0
i really don t know why people had problems with organic webs i personally had problems with the web shooters in amazing spider man,0
spider man b spider man b spider man d the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man a,0
you completely changed my view on this movie,0
matthew mcconaughey for green goblin in spider man please,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man a the amazing spider man d,0
i thought you were gonna give it atleast an a or a rating well a is pretty close i cant express how underrated this movie was among the superhero fan community,0
i m so happy that you did this chris,0
is an a better or worse than an a,0
spiderman gets his ass keked,0
i m really not a big fan of comic book movies and agree with what you said at the beginning but i am a big fan of this film,0
this the best spider man movie ever,0
chris where are your amazing spider man reviews i can only find trailer reviews,0
becoming an asshole from jokes is deadpool like,1
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man f the amazing spider man f,0
willem dafoe looks like a goblin so the helmet seems kinda unnecessary,0
bwaahahahahahahahaha that really got me laugh,0
william dafoe one of the greatest castings you ve ever seen hell nah unless you want overacting and cheesiness from your villain,0
well that s weird because i feel like these three movies are much darker than most marvel films now the battle damaged spiderman in this movie wasn t cheesy green goblin looked like a rich psychopath harry was conflicted the avengers movie seem more for children than spiderman and even seemed darker amazing spiderman wasn t even that dark the nd one was actually cheesy af antman isn t dark and gritty ironman are pretty cheesy too,0
this is awesome chris thanks i can t wait for you to review spider man if anything it ll also be to review spider man as both a review hilariocity,0
these are my grades spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man d the amazing spider man f,0
how often are these videos gonna come out,0
wait for deadpool,0
i will always love the score i like the sound of the rimshot the strings and the fast violins so good and catchy,0
i know a lot of people love these spider man movies but i can t honestly say i m one of them i don t need movies to be dark and gritty but they were just too cheesy for me and at no point in the movies did i really care if peter and mary jane got together which was a big part of them films to each his own i guess,0
my personal list spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man c,0
this movie is has a lot of cringeworthy moments and pretty whacky tones but still not a bad movie,0
y know i kinda wanna see chris review harry potter as well before fantastic beasts comes out,1
i never even realized that was jk simmons shows how well he acted in that role holy shit,0
no internet in well that is kind of impressive was the first time i used gprs contented to a computer via bt gprs was brand new and they had a marketing drive with month free internet if you used the gprs services but i guess home internet was a bit slow to catch on in the us where i lived in internet was quite common even at homes i was on my third internet girlfriend back then yea i m a bit needy so was they,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man d the amazing spider man f,0
yes i loved spider man,0
he s from,0
chris you re so clutch for this one of my fav movies of all time because of the nostalgia i used to come home from school and literally everyday watch this movie,0
where is mike stoklasa,0
does some math omg why the hell are you so young chris stop it like right now,0
first seconds of this video how i exactly feel about the marvel movies nowadays,0
i am a spider man fan for years this spiderman was real bad tobey isn t peter parker he was a real whining idiot mary jane was real bad a real dumb movie real dumb,0
i loved it then and love it now,0
i was born in and i grew up on this film i watched it all the time on vhs and i loved it i loved every thing about it and being a new yorker it connected with me i recently re watched it and i still love it and it s still my absolute favorite superhero movie till this day there are some scenes that don t have very good cgi like the scene where he s chasing down uncle bens killer and he s climbing up the wall it didn t look great but it s still an amazing scene because it s full of emotion to me the characters in this movie are extremely relatable like peter and his family,0
why hate on spin offs or universe lol we been begging the cross over live action movies since i was in the comic book store,0
thank you for your review of spider man,0
of course you grew up with spider man too,0
still a great film,0
i could honestly see people being completely unhappy if spidey was nonstop quippy hopefully we ll see the smart aleck kid spidey in civil war though i want his naive sense of wonder to show through spiderman loves being spiderman most of the time,0
the bus driver mocking was the best part of the review i never thought about how unrealistic that was,0
i actually still have a video cassette version of spiderman i used to absolutely adore those movies,0
wait is spiderman going to be in civil war,0
why hasn t willem dafoe played and joker old joker yet,0
toby was the better peter parker but andrew garfield had the better suit,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman b amazing sm c amazing sm b,0
people saying spider man is the best comic book movie of all time maybe yes but the dark knight is the best superhero film,0
this is my biggest nostalgia movie this was the first pg film i had ever watched and i loved every second of it i recently bought the trilogy on blu ray so i may watch each of them as chris reviews it,0
the second sam raimi spiderman film is still my favorite comic book show i m like chris spidey was my fav super hero growing up and the s animated series has a special place in my heart,0
raimi s version of the spider man series was always going to be very comic booky just watching the likes of the evil dead trilogy it has that comic book vibe to it especially with raimi s style of directing,0
i love this movie i owned and i thing is better then the amazing spider man cgi garbage sorry but that the true,0
for a spider man,0
willem dafoe was absolutely amazing especially when portraying that norman osborne green goblin dilemma the same goes with jk simmons as jj jameson who expressed a very convincing desire for pictures of spiderman,0
awesome review it made me go and watch the movie again so thanks chris,0
i prefer the amazing spider man series better,0
my childhood was glorious,0
the original trilogy is so refreshing to watch after the amazing spider man attempt great review chris,0
i can t believe all the comments i m seeing about spiderman being better than the amazing spiderman i thought it was universally agreed upon that was the worst topher grace as venom emo peter parker no carnage or hint at carnage thomas haden church s sandman topher grace as venom in no way shape or form was spiderman better than an superhero movie to date at least george clooney s batman and arnold s freeze made people laugh eric bana s hulk movie was better than spiderman and i don t even like the hulk,0
you are wrong dane was amazing as goblin,0
i seen this film so many times like you chris i used to watch amazing spider man for s now i need to see it one more time d btw great review waiting for moaaaah,0
great review for an awesome movie this video made me love this film even more i would like to see more long in depth reviews,0
you know how much i sacrificed,1
this and spider man were my favourite flicks at that time i haven t seen them in a long while but i think now after watching your review i m going to see them again regarding the goblin suit i actually didn t mind it but the one quip i did have was that because of the mask you couldn t see dafoe s facial expressions and i think it took away from his amazing performance i think they should ve went with just make up in that case but otherwise i can t agree with you more on this i remember the hype when this came out it was a great time,0
this was the first movie i ever saw in a movie theater i got dizzy due to the swinging sequences and my years old brother got afraid of the green goblin,0
this movie made my childhood,1
spider man b spider man a spider man d amazing spider man b amazing spider man b,0
and this is why i love the original spider man thanks chris it s really awesome to this day one of my favorite childhood movies and superhero movies of all time can t wait for your spider man review keep it up,0
to think that we could have gotten a spider man with dylan baker as the lizard and john malkovich as the vulture together with raimi and maguire and we instead got a cgi hell from webb and garfield dooming the series really makes me sad,0
great review,0
imo tobey mcguire better peter parker andrew garfield better spider man,0
i still like green goblin s suit i d like to see a more modernized version of it in future films,0
i loved the drawing scene the music was fuckin sick,0
i still love watching the sam raimi spiderman to this very day that movie made me a comic book fan instantly far beyond when i started looking at comic books before the movie came out it holds one special place in my heart,0
i love this movie but one of my biggest gripes with it is the fact that they masked willem dafoe i just wish they went with a different design for the green goblin i really like the second one the third is definitely the weakest but i still enjoy it i didn t enjoy the amazing spider man and they felt kind of heartless and cold in my opinion uncle ben quote in spider man with great power comes great responsibility uncle ben quote in the amazing spider man you are a lot like your father you really are peter and that s a good thing but your father believed by a philosophy a principle really he believed that if you could do good things for other people you had a moral obligation to do those things that s what s at stake here not choice responsibility what,0
for me this movie and their secuels are the worst spiderman versions of all versions i have seen why not review spectacular spiderman tv series or the s tv series i remember watching the movie when i was and thinking that this was made for little kids in comparison with the s tv series xd,0
and still no review for memento and the prestige,1
a nostalgia glasses on,1
chris oh my goodness man i can feel your energy about this movie from here great review you almost made me cry of emotion,1
toby was a better peter parker but andrew was a better spider man,0
shazam,0
i hate it how everybody seems to point to spider man and say see raimi s spider man movies sucked the amazing spider man is way better it s like everyone forgets how freaking awesome the first two movies were i even forgot some of the positives of the first one until watching this review,0
gosh i have such a crush on you,0
spider man was amazing,0
part imo was the best out of the three,0
love how you re doing this leading up to the new spider man appearance like you did with star wars,0
stop rebooting spiderman uncle ben is tired of getting fucking shot,1
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spiderman c the amazing spiderman b,1
i never liked it or any of the other spider man movies for that matter they just come of as being kinda goofy to me maybe it s because i grew up watching the amazing spider man tv series but i ve always felt that a spider man movie should be a coloured film noir,0
i knew i wasn t alone i really love the actors too,0
spider man a spider man b spider man c the amazing spider man c the amazing spider man b,0
strong review as always mr stuckann,0
great review it s so good to hear you say all the things i think about this movie i mean the cast is phenomenal and tasm herpes monster wow can t wait for the review on spider man,0
what a great review chris i m a huge spider man fan as well and i can t wait till you to review spider man one of the best comic book movies of all time looking forward to it eddy out,0
spider man c spider man c spider man d tasm b tasm c,0
i really hate it when people say oh this movie sucks because it s silly and campy it s directed by sam raimi who s a master at making cheesy and fun movies it s self aware and that s what makes it awesome,1
this review made me appreciate this movie so much more i last watched it when i was a lot younger and never really noticed all the subtle additions that made the movie great,0
nice in depth kind of review looking forward to your review of spider man i definitely appreciate raimi more for his work on this franchise and the evil dead he knows his stuff,0
i like andrew garfield as an actor and all but holy crap i couldn t see him being the geeky peter parker anywhere near as as good as tobey maguire love this trilogy,0
still the best spider man movie ever made,0
please review the iron giant it doesn t get the attention it deserves and besides no other review has done that film yet on youtube,1
yeah this is awesome i just watched all three of these movies super excited my favorite spiderman movies,0
i hope you cover the common complaint of peter crying too much in these films i feel like they were the right amounts of crying peter loses uncle ben who was like his father peter loses his best friend harry who have known each other for years peter cries when mj says they re done because he has wanted to be with her for basically his whole life she s the girl of his dreams and then she crushes his heart that s how peter saw it in the moment he didn t know she was being forced to break up with him by harry as far as we know peter never had a girlfriend before that after wanting to be with mj for so long he would not just quietly accept a breakup he would be devastated after loving her for so long,0
my ranking of the spider man movies from best to worst spider man a the amazing spider man a spider man a the amazing spider man c spider man d,0
spider man and first harry potter set me on a movie loving path when i was around,0
i always loved tobey as spider man and never understood why people preferred andrew garfield whenever this film is on i actually sit down and watch it because it never gets old for me,0
willem dafoe was excellent but there is one man who could have done it better christopher walken i bet that he is the green goblin irl the guy is craaaaaaaaazy,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c amazing spider man b amazing spider man c,0
lol ok dude from what i can guess from your past videos you re around my age years old so in that would make you a sophomore in high school i won t consider that age as kids but i remember the excitement this movie brought seeing it opening night to a packed theater and buying spiderman toys we were all happy kids again,0
cant wait till the spiderman review but i remember spidey getting his ass handed to him by green goblin it scared me at the time lol,0
mr stuckmann i have a question for you why don t you have a legend tom hardy plays gangster twins review have you not seen the movie,0
would you say that you decided to go back to formula,0
ohhh really excited for this series spiderman was my favorite superhero movie for a very long time,0
i read somewhere that nicolas cage was offered to play norman osborne green goblin back then and he turned it down i d imagine what his green goblin would ve been,0
speaking of the way green goblin looks did you ever see the original makeup test footage with the transformed goblin face pretty cool looking i would ve liked to see what the movie would ve liked like had they used that instead,0
i think the face herpes were compared to the ultimate comics green goblin,0
im just going to say it tobey was perfect as peter parker but wasn t comedic enough when playing as spiderman i feel like the character of spiderman was handled better in the amazing spiderman films and the peter parker character was better in the older ones,1
are you sure that s not a s spiderman porno good god that music anyway personally two words i hate hearin in reference to a comic book movie being made are grounded and realistic i go to super hero movies to see super heroes fantastical elements and all,0
one of the reasons villains hate spider man is his constant quipping p he should ve been a little more annoying to his enemies other than that almost a perfect comic book movie apart from the goblin suit,0
excellent review chris this movie was my childhood d,1
aren t you supposed to travel back in ttime two years to warn yourself about the wicker man,0
this was great it s hard not to agree with chris i love this movie and i need another spider man movie from sam raimi and tobey maguire i need it spider man was my star wars that amazing experience as a child going into a movie and just get blown away i have loved it ever since and it did so much justice to spider man and i was a huge spider man fan before seeing this gotta love sam raimi fuck you sony webb and garfield,0
a little more generous rating than i would have given it spider was an ok superhero movie at best the nd one was much better,0
why is he reviewing such an old movies,0
i m really excited for the amazing spider man re review sounds like chris has changed his mind about them,0
i don t like spider man or spider man movies in general but i did enjoy andrew garfield more than toby mcguire i think he s just a better actor neither are good at the character because i don t like the character,0
x men and spider man were the catalyst for the modern super hero film x men showed you could tackle real world issues and spider man showed you could have fun and exciting but still have adult action and stakes the combination of those two movies is how and why we get dark knight iron man guardians of the galaxy and batman v superman,0
do the iron giant please,0
we have the same age o,0
this movie was great i have no complaints about it,0
yeah my biggest problem with this movie is the green goblin suit it looks like shit other than that amazing film sadly the love story gets very lame in the sequels,0
my personal thoughts on the spider man films spider man a spider man a spider man d the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man c or d,1
i don t really like any spider man movies i hate spider man though i love the characters but i feel the acting and directing is sub par in every single film although toby maguire is a near perfect peter parker and andrew garfield was a great spider man as in when he is wearing the costume and the jazz club scene in is the most laughable and cringeworthy thing i have ever seen,0
i ve would have gone with a crappy komanrider costume lol,0
rewatching all these films nah i still disagree andrew was way better and felt more real and kirsten dunst was awfully miscast if it wasnt because of the secondhalf i would have considered tasm as the best spidey film,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman c the amazing spiderman a the amazing spiderman b,0
chris i love your in depth reviews where you use footage from the film to emphasize your point,0
finally spiderman i was wondering why i could not find it on your channel,0
this movie had the greatest final scene in movie history,1
oh shit im late for class and i think im single wait thats too crap,0
spiderman the amazing spiderman spiderman amazing spiderman spiderman,1
i m glad i m not the only one who really liked tobey as peter parker spider man and still do i haven t watched this one in a while so when you mentioned the fight scene with green goblin i was suddenly reminded of how visceral it was spider man is my all time favourite spider man film and i can t wait to hear you reviewing it great work as always,0
spider man will get an a calling it now the only thing wrong with that otherwise perfect film is the organic web shooters,1
i think the amazing spider man is the best spider man movie grabs popcorn,0
chris is my manz,0
review room pls,0
i haven t seen this movie for a very long time oh my god these memories o gonna watch it again very soon,0
why does stuckmann always look like he just came in his thumbnails,1
i ll always remember this movie as the first movie i saw that the film melted on screen it was during the final fight,0
hey chris please review labyrinth in honor of david bowie,0
my favorite spiderman movies the amazing spiderman spiderman the amazing spiderman spiderman spiderman my opinion isn t often popular but it is my opinion afterall,0
spiderman b spiderman a spiderman c the amazing spiderman a the amazing spiderman fuck it,0
i ve said this before and i still stand by it toby mcguire is the best peter parker but andrew garfield makes a better spider man,0
well can anyone actually come up with a green goblin costume that isn t gonna look silly in live action i surdenly can t,0
the best thing about sam raimi s spider man is the he absolutely nailed the tone of the films they are light hearted without being too goofy and over all really fun to watch one of my main problem with most of the modern marvel films is that the jokes feel misplaced to me,1
the first two films were good the third one was crap,1
thank you finally someone agrees with me,0
nice i enjoyed the spiderman movies as a kid as well i m going to rewatch the series too and see if i come up with similar observations,0
nice review,0
also the people who say the green goblin power ranger thing need to a remember that the power rangers were probably inspired by super hero comics so yeahb suggest a better alterative the isn t just something better i ve heard that people say he should be like the comics isn t that a mask where the mouth moves but can still be taken on and off how would that even work in a movie sure the suit looks a bit dumb but so would pretty much any goblin costume also final bit of ranting the people who say that this film is cutesy campy shit or whatever people who probably haven t even seen the film need to watch the end fight scene even now it makes be wince,0
can you make a review of the dutch film black the story comes from a book from a famous writer in belgium and is a romeo julia story in brussels between gangs i really like it and its a big succes here i would like to here your thought about it,0
and chris i love ya but i dislike this trend of you saying you shut out how you felt about films as a kid while re watching them you don t need to actively try so hard not to come off like a fanboy you also don t need to do this i agree that a certain level of objectivity is a good thing but you sound like you force yourself to not come off like a fanboy and you don t need to,0
a,0
i really need to rewatch this,0
i really enjoyed the first spider man great review chris,0
toby was amazing in this and,0
willem dafoe chewed so much scenery it was fucking glorious and jk simmons is the best adaptation of a comic book actor ever also raimi s camerawork is perfect for spiderman and of course elfmans awesome score and bruce the chin campbell cameo add to the cool,0
i tried watching the amazing spiderman on netflix couldn t get past minutes way to derivative and boring whatever people say about the original they had a style to them that was unique and was not as flooded by market forces like the current trend of superhero movies are today theres a feeling like you re watching a comic book and not a feeling like your watching a post generic action movie,0
spider man is better than spider man,0
chris ya done fucked up tobey was a terrible parker and an even worse spider man a real fan would know that if he knew anything about spider man sorry not sorry his acting was good but the writing and character they put forth was not and never will be spider man it was raimi man just like nolans take on the nolan man trilogy inaccurate as fuck to someone who knows wtf they re talking about lol,1
finally someone being positive about the first spider man movie one of my all time favorite comic book movies and i feel people focus on the bad way more than the good aspects of it,0
hell ya,0
i think the point of the web shooters in the comics was to show how smart peter was rather than just people say how smart peter was,0
spider man is the best spider man movie however even though i grew up with these films i still feel like the amazing spider man counts as the real spider man from my perspective,0
all i can remember is the pro wrestling scene,1
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man e,1
i have always loved this film i will literally watch this film at least once a month,0
i loved j k simmons as j jonah jameson,0
this was pretty much my star wars,1
spider man a spider man a spider man c amazing spider man b amazing spider man f,0
i would kind of like a dark and more violent story with spider man tho,0
i actually thought that movie was awful aside from getting to look at dunst,0
the spider man from will always be the best one i still remember the day i went to go see it with my parents it was extremely packed at the move theater kids and adults were so hyped for the film to this day it s still one of my favorite superhero movies,0
man when spiderman is getting his ass kicked is the highlight of the movie a super hero that has a bomb go off right near him blowing some of his costume off and him on the verge of death ya we won t ever see that again thanks sam raimi,0
you should have waited for the new spider man movie to do these reviews it would have been perfect for that cause we do not know how much spider man is in civil war probably not much,0
tobey maguire is to spiderman what christopher reeve was to superman,0
this is truly a great film the effects were groundbreaking and still look pretty good the music is mesmerizing the cast is fantastic the characters are all fleshed out and have individual arcs besides uncle ben but that s the point and just the overall quality of the film the camera angles sam raimi gets are so fantastic and unique which gives the movie it s distinct style and apart from a few moments the action is still awesome the reason it looks so real is because of the time it is practical effects and stunt work lastly the story is perfect it s the story of spider man people will always regard it as such even more so than amazing fantasy this gave us the girl next door mj this gave us the uncle ben responsibility bit this gave us bonesaw mcgraw this gave us the upside down kiss not only did this film successfully adapt spider man it defined it for a generation,0
i think this one is the best one in the franchise,0
the spiderman trilogy is one of the best trilogies in film history i even count spiderman though it has many issues i think it s very underrated a ton of enjoyment to be had but the second film is just truly a masterpiece wish they never got rid of tobey maguire also have the impossible dream of a spiderman from raimi,0
it wasn t happy uncle ben gets shot and spiderman gets all revengey,1
i will always like this movie better than the new one with andrew garfield in particular i didn t like him as spiderman in comparison to toby maguire he was kind of a stuck up ass who really ruined my love of peter parker,0
it was great for that time i remember this and attack of the clones came out around the same time everybody in high school couldn t stop talking about both films i wasn t crazy about green goblin s costume but other than that it was a solid film especially since they stayed close to the origin story it also set up the possibility for venom and possibly carnage in the sequels but we all know how that played out,0
i don t agree that mary jane was good in the movie but that s just my opinion,0
yep just rewatching that film score,0
just noticed but i love the jet force gemini poster it is such a great game,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c the amazing spiderman c the amazing spiderman d,0
oh yhae well im gona review all amazing spiderman comics ha,0
speaking of the evil dead you should totally review that franchise at some point,0
most anticipated video when if,0
uncle ben dies no way lol,0
well time watch raimi s spider man again,0
i loved how human they made mary jane with her verbally abusive father instead of having her perfect which is easy love the red hair,0
i like every spider man movie and i love the ot oh and kirsten dunsts tits,0
this was such an awesome review nice work chris,0
wow i just bought the blu ray trilogy yesterday,0
my personal rating would be sm a sm a sm b tasm a tasm c,0
finally someone in defence of organic web shooters even tho i love spider man the idea that he makes his own custom made web is odd to me,0
i kinda like andrew more as spiderman,0
stop saying it s the best comic book movie it s not i don t care if your comment section sense tickles it s nostalgia talking,0
i still remember reading the first appearance of sandman defeated by a vacuum cleaner doesn t get much cheesier than that,0
did he delete his original tasm reviews,0
here is a list of problems i had with this film a boat load of characters most of which we never learn about most of the roles miscast including tobey maguire as peter parker lame telling of the origin story love story too much of a puppy love romance no spidey sarcasism bullsh t change from mechanical to organic webshooters way too over produced spider man costume phoney visual effects kristen dunst s mary jane watson looking imperfect green goblin suit looking like a japanese action figure peter parker more of a photography geek j k simmons over the top performance as j jonah jameson convoluted plot flash thompson being mary jane s boyfriend mary jane being in the movie at all peter parker looking like the same guy with the glasses on and off cheesy dialogue j jonah jameson having a pencil mustache rather than a toothbrush mustache,1
i really hate mj she had to be saved in all three movies,0
,0
extremely happy yeah the bit where his uncle got shot was hilarious,0
the only raimi spidey film i like i know chris is gonna praise spider man and i m gonna be there wishing i wasn t one of the only people on earth who thinks its dogshit and yes i really like tasm a lot,0
the thing that i remember the most about the movie is that it came out right after we needed an underdog to give us hope and spiderman was definitely what we needed,0
back when superhero movies were good,0
the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout down came the goblin and took the spider out,1
spiderman,0
same for me but with peter and gwen,0
there is a woman in sm who is on the stage in the park when they announce spider man and she grabs her head and does this stupid ass omg type thing that drives me crazy i literally have to stop myself from punching the screen film extras wh do stupid shit should be exiled also irony of stuckmann mentioning how things said are commonly repeated on the internet just days after making the force awakens analysis video is hopefully not lost unless we are all to believe every idea chris mentioned in that video was his own ah the bliss of megalomania,0
i love this movie i was when i saw it i was so scared of william dafoe back then but now i just and love how goofy his performance is,1
the amazing spider man the amazing spider man spider man spider man spider man take note that i love all the spider man movies and i prefer the tasm series but the raimi movies are my childhood and are very fun entertaining movies including the third one,0
great review chris,0
well said chris i pretty much agree with what you said despite what people say about him i think tobey was great in the role overall and i too remember being on the edge of my seat during the final fight between spidey and the green goblin and it s quite amazing to think that this movie s almost years old damn,0
omg i only noticed the colors at the dinner scene now thats actually mind blowing to me lol,0
wohooooo awesome,0
spiderman a spiderman a spiderman d the amazing spiderman c the amazing spiderman d,1
i call this version spider man original spider man,0
great review although i think mary jane isn t fleshed out enoughed in this trilogy and spider man should have made more jokes also chris has subscribers,0
meh spider man was fun and all but it s not that great b,0
the movie who started all this superhero movie boom well this one and the first x men,0
someone search up the original green goblin suit it was fantastic,1
please tell me i m not the only one wanting to see chris crawling down the stairs as a kid saying look i m spider man,0
that shirt is amazing,0
and your amazing spiderman review,0
i grew up watching spider man and spider man and aside from star wars they re probably my favorite movies so happy for this review,0
in a lot of ways the first spider man is better than spider man but the latter film isn t hindered by obligatory exposition,0
my favorite thing about this movie is that every single frame if you pause looks like could be a picture from a comic book,0
chris when you come to poland i really wanna to met you,0
best casting choice of all time at least it s what i think is jeremy irons as alan rickman s brother in die hard with a vengeance,0
spider man is the best spider man movie,0
am i the only one who thinks that willem dafoe would be the perfect cast to play the joker,0
you chris,0
someone finally gives this movie the praise it deserves on point with that internet rant too,0
chris i what happened to your original amazing spiderman review,0
can t wait for your spider man review it s still my favorite,0
i want more of the original spiderman,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c amazing spider man f amazing spider man no desire to see it,0
i m glad you can actually enjoy peter and mary jane but i only saw the films last year and boy the dialogue between them was so cringeworthy really halted the movie for me all those times,0
i was not specting this but im glad about it,0
when marvel movies were good,0
chris ur making me want to put this movie in after work best superhero movie ever,1
like this movie a lot it definitely is a comic book movie so i don t mind those sillier moments the movie has some slightly dated cgi and green goblins suit could have been better but overall still great also really glad you talked about j k simmons here because he was perfect good review again chris,0
i was this movie in theatre when i was and damn almost years later it s still a great film,0
i must have watched this movie about million times by now and never realised that choice of costumes at the dinner table chris you ve blown my mind,0
this movie is honestly the only comic book movie i could honestly say might be just as good as the dark knight,1
people hate on these spiderman movies so much i think they re just perfect honestly great review as always,0
this is my favorite superhero movie of all time it s not the best just my personal favorite,0
i did that too,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c tasm c tasm d,1
watch the learning to web spin scene in punjabi it s so funny xd,0
spider man b spider man ii a spider man iii c the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man ii c,1
most superhero movies of today are dark because they all want to copy the best superhero movie s ever made the dark knight trilogy,0
havnt seen this movie in a long time but i can relate to the carling down the steps thing when i first seen this movie when i was younger my mind was blown and loved it even though i was only at the time i liked it so much i watched it everynight on dvd for a bout a year or so lol one of my first favorite movies,0
thanks for the upload d,0
i love the finale of this movie with the suit getting torn to shreds in all the movies it s so real marvel doesn t do stuff like this,0
spider man from best superhero movie ever,0
willem dafoe joker anybody,0
i think this is actually my favourite spider man flick i like as someone who grew up as a science nerd the whole science has to be used for good speech felt weird,0
damn you chris now i need to watch this movie again,0
waiting this for the entire week im really excited to see the other reviews,0
this film is such a guilty pleasure of mine it s so funny and cheesy,0
i had the toys of these two goblin with his plane thing don t know what s called in english and spider man man i wish i still had these toys the fucking quality in them was incredible spider man fingers could even be moved to make the hand shape for web shooting i m glad you re reviewing this and that you liked it i personally loved this series of movies being the best of course for the power ranger suit i think it was a brilliant idea if you think of peter gaining muscle and strength because of the powers you would think that osbourne would have to have something as well to be equivalent in this case was the serum that power armor suit as a kid i thought it was badass as fuck d,0
i do love this film but my main problem is that peter climbs a couple of walls does pro wrestling and suddenly he s an expert that came out of nowhere,0
can t wait for the second movie review,0
didn t really like spiderman back then still don t but it was a good movie though,1
so once he uploads updates impressions of amazing spiderman movies chris will have resorted to remakes,0
whaaa don t your tickets have seat numbers,0
this is actual my favorite movie of all time i agree with everything you said chris great review,0
a sam raimi movie do the evil dead movies,0
i think spider man knew exactly what it was and didn t try to be anything else which is a huge credit to sam raimi it s such a fun origin story,0
oh wow i didn t know you were a bus attendant before chris i was for years but am now a bus driver myself and yeah nobody would risk that haha i like tobey but the whole cast always felt so old just look at the kids in that school bus i actually do think andrew garfield was a better spider man although as peter parker he was way too cool so tobey a better peter garfield a better spidey that s my opinion anyways p,0
i wish they would ve brought back mcguire s spidey because he is already an established character and the tone of his films fit the mcu a lot better plus he has a reason to be in either team,0
i don t think anyone would complain and in fact i think they would be delighted if jk simmons was brought back for j jonah jameson in the new spider man films,0
spider man it s a film made by people chris stuckmann,0
does anyone else think william dafoe would be a good joker,0
spider man a spider man a spider man c amazing spider man d amazing spider man d,1
i once went back to watch this after hearing hero on the radio,0
spolier alert i laughed my ass off when green goblin accidentally killed himself with his hover vehicle,0
as a kid i remember watching spider man and friends spider man and mtv s spider man,0
personally i prefer the amazing spider man movies for one thing the people actually feel like people and the dialogue is much better also mary jane has nothing going for her that makes me really want to see peter and her get together i watched this movie again recently and i thought it was okay i definitely don t like it as much as i used to,1
so was that some porn music,0
jk simmons is still j jonah jameson to this day watch any recent marvel universe cartoon he s there marc webb may not have had him back for the amazing spider man films but he basically is not relinquishing the role and that s awesome,1
it was not,0
chris you can t praise spiderman for being gleeful and cheesy and bash avengers for the same shit,0
spider man b spider man a spider man c amazing spider man b amazing spider man d,0
best origin superhero movie so far great movie emotional funny exciting the cgi hold up good everything you wanted from a movie,0
why does everyone still love spiderman with maguire so much i rewatched them recently except the third because come on and they aged horribly i was seriously bored it kind of destroyed all the good memories i had from watching them as a teen,0

i really enjoyed amazing spider man yeah i m serious,1
the nostalgia uhhhhh,0
favorite movie of all time,0
the first two spider man movies were so good and i miss the simplicity of marvel movies back in the day lol i still remember going to see this movie in theaters and it impacted my younger life in a big way this movie is definitely one of the movies that started my love of movies,0
i really have only one complaint with this movie and its a small one i wish green goblin was an actual goblin with green skin i think that would have added to the funness of the movie,0
spider man b spider man b spider man d the amazing spider man b the amazing spider man d,1
i remember watching the movie as a kid and dear god i loved it every time i watch it now i just feel like a kid agian,0
that was the most truthful opening line i have heard in a long time,0
fuck boy,1
great the day of my birthday my favorite critic reviews one of my earliest memories of going to the movies and i still love that movie,0
spiderman is the best superhero film ever made,0
love the films watched em when i was ill lol keep it up,0
spiderman is still probably my favorite i was obsessed with doc oc when it released and bought all his legos and action figures at the time because of how good that movies was saw it alone in the movie theater man it was a great night i still enjoy and remember my cousins always playing the hero music video on this dvd all the damn time,0
spider man is still my all time favorite superhero movie,1
great film loved it as a child,0
tobey mcguire best live action spider man,1
this is the best marvel movie for me all the magic started here folks no x men are not marvel movies edit this comment was from a true mcu fan,0
i haven t watched this review yet but i will warn you chris if i find you disliked william dafoes performance we re gonna have a problem xd,1
can you do movie series as a whole reviews like minutes of reviewing all movies as one including loop holes creative commections etc,0
i ve got exams tommorow i m way behind on my work i should be doing my work fuck it what s minutes going to do edit worth it,1
i was watching spiderman when you uploaded this,1
love when you review older movies hopefully you will start reviewing classics soon that would be awesome,0
i much prefer having a connected universe especially if it s being done as well as marvel s been doing it besides comics have been doing shared universes for decades so why shouldn t the movies do it too,0
spider man and are two of the best comic book movies of all time,1
wow this came way unexpected for me but damn i really can describe how happy i am when i saw this video thanks for this mr stuckmann,0
spider man well this was unexpected,1

ayeeeee,1
wooooooo,0
last time i came this early i slept on the sofa,1
nostalgia,0
ayy,0
i adored this movie when it came out its slightly dated in certain areas but it still holds up although i disagree with the spider man quips as the series went on he became more and more joyless,1
this video took the combined effort of people to finish in a week please for the love of jk simmons like comment and share this video if you enjoy it,1
i m not crying you re crying,0
action aside raimi trilogy was so much better narratively especially as a hero film holland villains were mostly simple you should stop me and the answer and resolution was essentially spoonfed and had to be thrust upon peter whereas maguire villains and theme were should you stop me having peter s character becoming the rock and conviction for the resolution homecoming was the closest in respect but lacked cohesiveness and independence and no way home was just a cheat derivative by needing to borrow other established characters p s i also love garfield s spiderman tho,0
i m glad i got over my really petty i don t like the way his oc looks to enjoy your content it s some of my favorite stuff over the last decade since i became obsessed with video essays,0
all of them are better miles and miles better than all of the tom holland ones and andrew garfield ones were,0
i lost my grandma in too i also never got to say goodbye i feel you man,0
in the novelization form of spiderman doc ock actually was being knocked out constantly its just the arms that kept him awake,1
shouldn t have watched this while eating,0
the first spider man film was written so good that it flew over people heads if peter was responsible and told harry immediately what happened it wouldn t have ruined his friendship between them green goblins last words don t tell harry was the final blow to spider man that eventually destroyed him,0
i admire spiderman despite the expectations i think all of them play off of each other equally,0
spider man is the best one it doesn t matter what anyone says the rd one is the greatest one ever perfect,0
maybe it s just me but i kind of feel like reimi was speaking through sandman to the audience when he said i didn t want this but i had no choice i would ve loved to see his original vision venom could ve waited and that s coming from a venom simp,0
i m locked into deep depression in my life literally wishing to die every day and there were moments of the first movie review you addressed that literally brought me to tears i love these movies and you gave me even more love for them there are ways in which i feel like peter parker in the first movie and i wish i had the same trajectory as his i wish i had a woman to lift me up like i used to i wish i had a community that was there to help me or even save me i feel so intensely lonely in almost every way and i don t know what to do to fix it,0
i really wish they made a spiderman aunt mays words to peter about everyone needing a hero was like she knew he was spiderman,0
edward norton the that kidnapped cory,0
this trilogy absolutely tops any other spiderman film series i ll never understand how people don t appreciate them and enjoy the others more not just because i grew up with them it s not just a nostalgia thing like,0
no many youtubers i can say i ve watched for years but you re one of em thanks man,0
tobey is the goat,0
all sam raimi spider man films are a delicacy yes even the third and make me cry my eyes out upon every watch you can tell that everyone involved in the projects had a massive care love for the art as childish as it may sound these will forever live in my heart as some of the best movies of all time,0
the argument about the mask not forming to the actors face which leads to the character not having emotion is bogus imo there are so many other characters in fictions who wear masks helmets where you can t see there mouths nose or eyes form under the mask who still portray emotion through their voice acting and body language i mean look at v for vendetta the mandalorian darth vader master chief from the halo games etc during emotional scenes these characters portrayed emotion through their voices and body language and toby s spider man is no different,0
it s actually confirmed that spiderman was knocking doc ock out the arms were waking him up keeping him conscious,0
i watched this trilogy for the first time earlier this year and i honestly like how the train passengers don t say anything about him with his mask off they easily could ve taken a photo of it but they didn t,0
in the spiderman novel it says the the arms are what keep otto awake making him hard to take down,1
i always thought that the first movie was about peter and the second was about spiderman the third being both of them coming together and getting on the same page,0
we can t see spidermans emotions through the mask isn t that how it is in real life when you wear a mask i guess darth vader needs a cgi mouth and eyes too so we can see he s mad right lmao what a nonissue,0
i never took any issue with the lack of expression on the raimi suit the tension of the scene spoke for itself green goblins mask was hard and unmoving yet we see him go through a myriad of emotions and they all come through the actors did a fantastic job willem dafoe especially,1
i m glad you didn t bash spider man like all the other people on the internet,1
i say venom should have been saved for the movie after the culmination of peter s journey a lack of responsibility a painful ego hatred and unforgiveness he should be an evil spider man at first then mutate into venom a shadow a monster of peter s creation while eddie was the perfect vessel,0
if you split the mask shell and made it so that there were separated cheek panels to let them push on the mask surface you could telegraph talking and jaw movement well maintaining the shell and then just have normal full shell masks for stunt doubles but then the main character can show when he s smiling or his mouth is open,0
yo how have i been subbed for years and never known about this video,0
you should watch the cut clips of sandman it has more character development moments like him confronting the scientist that technically made him sandman as well as him making a sand castle for his daughter and them meeting,0
man dont let the custom force spiderman down,0
tobey man s suits were perfect at the time face shield and all the only thing i would even consider changing for a modern version would be to add the expressive eyes from the holland movies also i know it s a hot take but spider man is better than the peter stuff is more relatable may and ben feel exactly like my irl grandparents and the level of abuse taken by tobey in the end fight manages to make it feel like he could actually lose despite knowing how it ends tobey man is still a movie but the first one has the tiniest bit more special sauce also mj s parade outfit,1
after watching this review i need you to come back to the bnha review i love how you undertand heroes and your analisis,0
the problem with spider man punching doc ock is look how strong spider man is he could crush doc ock s skull like a grape but tell me this exactly how hard would you need to punch a grape to knock it unconscious without causing serious and crippling permanent injury if the safety of the grape was a priority to you even as the grape was misbehaving do you know the exact amount of strength it would take to safely disable the grape or would you end up erring on the side of the grape s safety pulling your punches so much that you might need to punch multiple times rather than risk crippling or killing the grape i don t mind your concern but since you said this was bothering you in what is otherwise one of your favorite films i wanted to give you a perspective that might make it easier and more enjoyable to rewatch in the future,0
that and like matpat proved true in one of his film theory videos this film whether or not it was intentional was made as a critique of when you try to have too many burdens while suffering from depression and ptsd,0
i can t stand mary jane and harry in these movies the trilogy is great phenomenal even but they drag them down majorly for me,0
i actually prefer that the mouth isn t visible in spider man s design,1
i can definitely see the flaws in spider man especially venom now as an adult but as a kid this movie was amazing and is what made me fall in love with venom,1
as a kid i loved the bit where goblin said oh,0
may be an unpopular opinion but i love the original makeshift suit it s my favorite homemade suit in all of the live action movies,0
its my favorite hero just for you as for me and i totally agree with mark,1
i thought an ad started playing,1
but for me the musk is okay and the mask itself shows emotion when they talk we imagine in our head like iron man musk,0
one of my favorite aspects of spider man is how you can watch it a thousand times and still i learn something new like the other day somebody pointed this out the reason that peter is able to reach out to doctor octopus at the end is because he went through the character arc of having to realize that he needs to give up the things that he want the most to be a hero that he needs to give up on ego and only because of that he s able to reach doc oc at the end of the movie it s one of my favorite scenes just because like the entire story of it,1
i always kind of assumed otto had a different more refined version of the goblin serum to be able to be strong enough for his spine to be able to support those arms same way that we see harry has a version of the goblin serum that doesnt make him crazy only i always had the idea of if the arms shoot it into his bloodstream through his spine which is why he and spidey can brawl without knocking him out,1
going back and re watching these made me feel the same way too man i take peters story much more into account now that im older,1
while i understand marks opinions about the suits and he makes good points his takes are clearly from someone coming from animation and not film making so i can t side with him on it,0
growing up is realizing william was right,0
that g fuel ad was pretty great give mark your money give me your money lol,0
very well done video review you picked up on some things i didn t when i watched these films i m going to rewatch them with that in mind for sure i agree with you that the stiff mask hid some of the emotion it would have been more effective if the jaw at least moved when he talked at least the movies added the combat damaged mask at the end of all of the movies to show the characters face i gotta say hands down spiderman is my favorite spidy movie,0
what an amazing video bro,0
i think rami should ve put the symbiote in the movie but not venom he should ve had peter get the symbiote and just be black spiderman then just the same in the movie he learns bout sandman killin ben and becomes alot more aggressive and then accidentally kills harry during the nd fight and it makes pete come to his senses and rips off the symbiote and it to either land on eddie or somehow find eddie and the end credits show him turning into venom and after that since we had a movie to breakdown and have time to build up the symbiote and give it time to sit and us have time to process it then during production of the th movie rami can spend much more time to learn about and learn about venom so he can get it right and not just cut corners due to not understanding the character you may disagree but imo i think that would ve fixed everything and maby hopefully not get that horrendous dancing scene,1
in the novelization of the movie it is said that every punch that spider man threw at ock knocked him out and the arms kept bringing him back to consciousness,1
these movies are being rereleased in cinemas at the time i write this and i remember sitting in the cinema being not only excited to watch them but to watch these reviews again with the context fresh in my mind totally not mark is such a good find for me on this platform,0
tobey maguire is the greatest spider man of all time,1
thanks now im crying wonderful job,0
the first spider man movie from will go down as the best spider man movie it s just perfect to me,0
spiderman is the greatest superhero movie ever made i love this trilogy so very deeply due to how much love raimi put into bringing these characters to life on the big screen the quality of writing in spiderman and alone is truly astounding and endearing,1
doc ock was knocked out with every punch the arms kept him going,0
breaks me so damn hard as a broke college student who feels so lost in life this scene hit so close to home i legitimately tear up every single time i see it,1
i m sure you alr know this but the bruce cambell joke was actually supposed to set him up as mysterio in either the fourth or fifth installment of his rami series but sadly he hated so much he quit entirely,0
actually spiderman is my favorite of the trilogy,0
jjj was by far the best spider man,0
geez mark you can make me shed a tear just talking about movies spider man has always been my favorite hero as well and i think melodrama can actually get at the heart of what makes people tick more than we give it credit for fantastic video as always years late nah this video is evergreen so my comment is too,0
to your spider man punching humans is just overkill the superior spiderman comic line has a funny nodd to that when oc gets pete s body he is just blown away by how unbelivabley strong he is and a little horrified to find out how much he was holding back knowing he could have killed him with no effort anytime he wanted,0
id heavily disagree id say despite the lack of facial emotions is more than made up for by the body language and the cinematography i think a still mask is far superior its more menacing and it fullfills the purpose of the mask spider man doesnt wear a mask just for protecting his identity but he made it specifically to hide his emotions most specifically fear we see his eyes move in the comics but in that world those people dont see that only we do for the sake of the story the static mask fits this perfectly it masks his emotions and makes him intimidating the criminals of new york despite it not being touched on as much fear spider man and a lot of that is due to not just his inhuman contorting but his mask i dont think an enclosed and emotionless face is a hinderance to a character or preformance if that was the case the mandalorian wouldnt be successful nor would v for vendetta be as good as it is v for vendetta is an excellent example of both nonexistant facial emotions and minimal body language still resulting in a captivating and emotional character i think tobey did a well done job doing this we see in no way home they attempted to mix both cgi and a moving mouth to a static mask with andrew garfields character and it looked horrible and unnatural other than that this is an amazing video and an even more spectacular retrospective well done man,1
this trilogy is even better than the batman trilogy there s never been and never will be a super hero masterpiece like this,0
creaky sent us over from his cannel to support you i hope you get everything sorted out i love anime and would hate to see a channel taken down from something i love,0
this trilogy is amazing and when i saw the rd movie i liked it i could see the mess and i thought making it longer could have helped it but it was still a good movie,0
while i didn t grow up seeing these movies in theaters i did watch them at home while i do prefer andrew and tom s portrayal of peter spidey better this video has given me a new found appreciation for a trilogy i already liked i may even say i love these movies now hell i love all the spidey movies to varying degrees of course,1
i know it s late but sorry for lost man if it s any consolation your a great guy doing a great thing here on youtube it may seem small simply talking about series you love and sharing those thoughts but i can say as a fact that these reviews are an escape for lot of people for me personally i love these videos i plan to become a storyteller to put it simply books poems manga comics cartoons the works and i gotta say your video s have helped me see things on a narrative and personal level that even i didn t know about the shows i love sometimes i legitimately put these reviews on to ease my mind or get the creative juices flowing even if i m just cleaning and not feeling it they really help there s a hero in all of us and you definitely have one in you,0
bro the thing with the fight in the train were spiderman punches doc oc but doesn t knock him out is something that has baffled me since i was a child this is literally the first time i ve heard someone else mentioning it in fact when you first mentioned the fight it was the first thing that popped in my mind love your reviews and your channel keep it going bro,0
spiderman has the pulling and grip strength to lift a train but average pushing and therefore punching strength,0
the costume looks sick,0
deffo had the best spider man soundtrack of all time the nostalgia is insane,0
,0
that cut at lovely,0
i kinda disagree about the mask covering up peter s mouth movements i ve watched plenty of shows and movies where either a character s face was obscured or they even didn t have a face but still manage to give an emotional performance a clear example for me is the question from the justice league cartoon the dude wears a mask that makes it look like he has no face you don t get the mouth movements but despite this his body language and dialogue more than adequately show his emotions in the episodes honestly the justice league cartoon is just peak superhero animation all around i highly recommend it willem dafoe is perfect as green goblin i can t see anyone else as the character at least in live action so glad they were able to get him back for no way home,1
excellent real video,0
damn maybe it was a good thing for me to be spider man every halloween because i can t think of anybody else i wanna be,0
the explination on why peter doesnt knock out cold doc oc si because he still needs to practice how to control he s strenght and he can only use or to little por to much and since he was really used to punch normal criminales he got used to use little strenght,0
i still think the tom holland movies still capture the character better and are better movies but this trilogy is still something special and should be held in the highest regard,0
love how all that was for a g fuel ad,0
i find it funny how green goblin s hero speech basically gets mirrored by aunt may in the sequel goblin sees being a hero as a pointless task that heroes are a fad and that whilst people love spider man now they ll eventually get bored of him and would be more entertained seeing him die than continue fighting for them meanwhile aunt may believes that spider man brings out the good in people and that by being a hero he inspires those that see him to be the very best they can and that spider man and his legacy will be around a lot longer than peter actually will it makes the scene that was already emotional even more nuanced and great,1
hearing the ps spider man theme during this video makes me want to hear mark s thought on that version of spider man maybe before insomniac s spider man releases,1
mark i just pulled my phone out of my pocket and it told me that i just submitted some sort of report against you and i absolutely did not i love your videos and watch them all the time so i am sorry if this flagged you for whatever reason,0
i thought you were the dragon ball review guy lol,0
i recently rewatched these movies for the first time since i saw them as a kid and i must say spider man genuinely shocked me the overarching theme of forgiveness both for oneself and others rings just as true as the theme of sacrifice from the prior film furthermore while i can t condone making uncle ben s killer a significant individual nor the handling of venom i do have to admit that having ben s murder come back to haunt peter to drive him to give in to his worse impulses does make sense moreover making eddie into this pitiful slimeball who were genuinely and personally mistreated by peter goes a long way in showing that venom were a result of peter s own flaws as opposed to him just being some nobody who wrongfully blamed spidey for his own error in judgement during the sin eater case it s still the worst movie out of the three but i don t actually feel like it s straight up bad either,0
that was the best commercial plug i ve ever seen nice,0
i guarantee aunt may knows that peter is spider man,0
it s sort of confirmed in the spider man videogame that he pulls his punches,0
so mark are you going to review the two deadpool movies before the third one comes out next year,0
with spider man i m actually very shocked with sam rami not wanting to do venom he seems like the perfect villain for rami from a narrative stand point due to the potential of black suit spider man and venom having but also from a directing stand point since sam rami is a horror director i actually think sandman was the biggest mistake in terms of villain choice all his character really did was bring back the uncle ben murder plot but we ve moved past that and i don t know why we should revisit it and it takes away from the first movie in my opinion,0
this is one of the best retrospectives on youtube,0
and now we see why we dont have the complete dbz review i m with it though,0
repent and believe in christ,0
in my mom was dying her first and still currently only grandchild couldn t go and say goodbye thanks to lockdowns granted i know he wouldn t remember it it s still something i feel he should ve done that nurse still pisses me off to this day and i ve never wanted to violently react so someone before but it was tough to not do so,0
the human spider,0
rewatched spider man recently,1
no no no no noo attack on titan and spider man i m unapologetically totally not gay for tnm edit we are who we choose to be really you gonna just toss the iron giant in there like it s nothing marry me,0
is it a mistake that doc oc responds to peter at the end of the movie with a privilege when earlier in the movie he had said it was not a privilege something i just noticed,0
god is good hallelujah onto the lord jesus christ of nazareth thy son of the most high god alot of people these days look down on heroic ideal and prefer negative mindsets though i feel like if the world doesn t value the ideals taught in the bible and in the trilogy then we will just end up worse,1
until now bro tobey maguire hes the best spiderman no one replaces him because my childhood superhero,1
lord why do people hate on andrew garfield,0
these films will forever hold a special place in my heart we always have a choice and we can always choose to do what s right resonated with me so much as a year old about to step into a world full of bad choices available for short term pleasure seeing spiderman sacrifice made me strong in my own faith that i too could choose to sacrifice and do what s right i can t say enough about how much that meant to me for years throughout my life seeing the suffering that came with spiderman s decision to do so made it feel that much more real and therefore made me resonate with the message that much more mark i sincerely mean this i love this video and thank you so much for sharing your vulnerability and poignant thoughts you re a gem,1
oh green goblin norman osborne circa,1
i think the emotionless mask of spider man serves to help what spider man stands for the lack of skin showing and the fact that the face is always the same gives the idea especially to younger people that anybody can be brave powerful and smart just like spider man is,1
i do agree the lose of trump was tragic inflation is a hell of a burden on all of us i ll take those mean tweets back to save money again,0
though it had its flaws i enjoyed spider man when it came out,1
we get to see the man in spiderman,1
i believe you have commited a crime in this video,0
i always loved mary jane s character i feel she s overlooked a lot bc of her dating choices but i genuinely feel like she s the closest to a teenage girl with trauma and fear it was something about her that made me feel attached to her growing up and felt like i finally saw a movie character i could relate to i wish she was praised more rather than bashed on,1
i believe theres a hero in all of us hit hard,1
so not only is peter totally holding back his punches for otto because he respects him but otto s brain is currently being controlled by ai that he installed into arms that aren t feeling those punches they re probably the only things keeping him upright,1
i maybe watched your video before watching spider man but it s a way tied with thor and the dark world for the most overhated overlooked and underrated pieces of marvel they do have problems but there is some of marvel s recent stuff that makes me look back at these and realize they are better,1
i believe that when peter stops that train or to those amazing things like lifting that building he knows he is doing something important he is saving lives so when he punches doc ock he doesn t get that strength im not sure if im explaining this clear but that is what i think,1
i always saw and said that spider man is the most human super hero movie ever created and even now when im it still is my favourite movie and it always will be,0
i agree with your thoughts on the themes of spider man but i still believe the execution was done so poorly that it just doesn t actually achieve them properly,0
i just like how peter reveals that he s spider man when he s ripping off his outfit in front of thousands of people,0
also every in the movie peter said to uncle ben that you re not my father then stop acting like my father and in end he tells goblin he had a father his name was ben parker character development at its best,1
i wish they just kept sandman as the main villain in spiderman because in the beginning half of the movie you can tell how much they introduced and built up the sandman character but then sony wanted more villains and became to jumbled up and weird,1
it is stated in the comics that spiderman always pulls his punches a lot to not hurt anybody but if he wanted could kill anybody with one punch,1
j k simmons is the best spiderman,1
made me laugh yeah the supporting character to the civilians was well done especially someone always playing a spidey song it definitely felt more like a comic not taken seriously,1
if peter can do this and this and this he should be able to knock out doc oc even if he s pulling his punches they actually address this in the superior spiderman comics peter is always subconsciously pulling his punches to not just kill everyone he fights as in his limits aren t physical they re psychological,1
spider man is a terrible movie not just because of the complete disrespect of venom bad acting bad direction bad pacing horrible writing,0
i wanna know how you feel about the furthering of these characters in no way home you talk about how otto was the main hero in spider man but how does that change when tom s spider man interferes and saves cures them,0
at least i m not the only one who doesn t have a sweet clue of what he s supposed to do,0
whoaaa spider man stopped,0
okay so thats sold i m getting g fuel,1
andrew garfield the best,1
during the train fight spider man is only as strong that he needs to be in the specific moment,1
personally i saw no issues between his strength and the octavius fight the only times you ever see him use this superhuman strength is when the lives of not only himself but other people hangs in the balance in the real world there s something known as hysterical strength where people are able to use a level of strength that they shouldn t you ll find it a lot reading up on cases about parents who lifted an entire car yes a car to save the life of their child through sheer willpower and determination that s the best way to explain these moments away imo and honestly it s an incredible attention to detail and makes the hero feel a lot more human than super and it s part of why i still think of the second movie as one of the best movies ever made,1
i love venom too i think he works better as an anti hero now makes me want a modern spiderman venom vs carnage movie like right now,1
say anything bad about tobey and i ll throw some dirt in your eyes,1
wait how did you see spider man in theaters four times and not ever end up owning lol,0
best freaking retrospective ive ever seen,1
dude thank you so much for using insomniac s spiderman soundtrack,1
i d like to see how that poll would look after no way home,0
day of begging mark to read gantz,0
nwh hit different,1
spiderman is and will forever be peak,1
this is exactly what the immeasurable stan lee would say,0
my favorite spiderman movies,0
make me cry like you did talking about the nd movie again and i will be damned if i ever watch ur videos again,1
venom is the bad guy because venom is the symbiot and venom took over tobey maguire peter parker,1
my grandma died in totally out of nowhere on mother s day we were supposed to go and spend the day with her but because my brother and his wife had plan a trip by their own exactly on mother s day we had to reschedule and because of that stupid trip i didn t got to be with my grandma the person that raised me one last time since then i feel broken and scare of the next phone call that will change my life forever again,1
love spiderman love totallynotmark great video cheers to you guys finishing this video in a week that s impressive d,1
my own personal hot take venom looked better in spider man than he does now in the hardy movies the hardy movies venom feels more blatantly like cgi all the time and never really blends well with the environment it s in where as s feels more natural and real looking in it s scenes particularly the face and mouth jaw when they let the face be seen that is i hope that if we do end up with venom in the mcu we get one that utilizes better cgi for it like with stark and spidey s suits to make it feel more organic and natural looking for the scenes it s in like s did,1
spiderman is always holding back against most everyone he never uses his strength to it s limit he knows what he can do and doesn t,1
i miss stan,1
i drew the ultimate spiderman specifically symbiote version cuz it was easy and i grew up playing ultimate spiderman,1
being born in the s the animated series spideman unlimited and the raimi trilogy is what i prefered,1
can we talk about the fact that in the first spider man j jonah jameson totally figures out peter s identity from looking at the pictures he s offered when they first meet it s in his eyes he s completely figured it out in his head and yet he says nothing because the pictures were perfect for him to capitalize on these movies are so brilliant with these kinds of subtle details had to rewatch them again after your reviews p,1
rip to granny mark i lost mine in,1
i like to think peter lost his powers because madame web allowed it speaking of her i d love to see rosemary harris play madame web,1
make another video about how current spiderman movies are shitty including garfield s,0
there s nothing romantic or emotional with current spiderman movies,0
honestly spider man is still better than anything that s come since,1
watching this review made me realize what made spider man the weakest was that it put its message above the means to get to it organically the contrivances that were there like the weak explanation for harry to learn the truth and other things were to get the plot to the point the message needed while the movie still works unlike the last jedi it ends up weaker than the others a few more weeks even days in the planning stages would have improved on how to make the means for the message in a more natural way,0
i m sure tobey s spiderman would have a patreon these days,1
agreed rosemary harris is the mvp of the trilogy she cliff robertson and j k simmons in particular are as though pulled directly from the page,1
during this lockdown the same things happened to me i got burdened by an avalanche of negativities then i re watched it i needed spiderman,1
spiderman does not waste a single second during the length of the movie it s packed with info that all add to the whole theme of the story and gives us viewers just about enough time to process it and take us on one hell of an emotional ride,1
i was so ready to leave a dislike on this video when i realized your fake trailer was an ad and then you said give mark your money and how can i leave a dislike after that,1
good vid man almost made a grown man tear up,1
yea i still think the sam raimie trilogy is the best one the newest and andrew garfield trilogies are just not good i really hate the newest one especially it doesn t actually feel like a spiderman movie it feels like a marvel movie and i think no way home was the stupidest spiderman movie ever they seriously butchered everything about spiderman that i liked,1
spider man was my favorite growing up i was lucky enough to read spider man as a kid watch that fox kids show then get these movies i think they all did well by him the idea that anyone can be the hero and can inspire more,1
thnks for this video a whole generation of young men need it,1
i ve seen lots of videos about spider man but this really opened my eyes and saw how great the film really was thanks for that i wanna rewatch it now,0
that train scene in spider man is more enjoyable to watch then the eternals,1
mary jane gets too much hate she along with all the other characters were perfect i don t think people fully understand the points that her character was going through and ignored all the bad petet was bringing to the relationship,1
spiderman gets hated on too much and is a tad better than the emo peter is just as cheesy as the raindrops montage from spiderman,1
tom holland and tobey maguire and urgent garfield,0
thank you spider man is awesome,0
that gfuel ad,0
such a soppy wimp,0
dude you put a lot of work into these great work,0
dude you knocked this right out the park and i feel your pain i lost my great grandmother to cancer years ago nd miss her everyday keep doing you mark you are spectacular,0
having rewatched these films and the others for no way home i m glad to see you singing the praises of rosemary harris as a youngster her parts in the films were good as an adult they hit way harder and she is absolutely the emotional glue that keeps the raimi films together,0
spider man inspired me to be confident because my family did rubbish things to me and cant be like my friends so when i saw that i learnt that everyone has problem,0
in the costume section theres one more good thing about it as stan lee said my favorite part of the suit is that any kid could image there spider man no matter race,1
mark where the fuck did that film quality for that gfuel ad come from you re hiding your talents from us man,0
omg that ad was incredible,0
i like to think doc ock was either being prot cted and kept conscious by the neural link or if he was knocked out it migh have killed him or let the arms completely loose i mean there s logically reasons there tbh,0
uh ohhhh,0
you used the phrase lived experience in the only appropriate way i never thought i d hear it again,0
give me spider man by sam raimi,0
and also after not mark said theres a other yeah and you can hear norman yelling a bit,0
yeah i agree that tobey diserses he s love i mean sam raimi started the live action movie buuuuuttttt we started to get some visiters i had to do it d and dont mind the picure of my dads profile its just my moms face,0
aunt may reminds me so much of my grandma always positive and looking after me sadly i got to know what i had after i lost it am i a hero i think not,0
i don t agree with greg being happy he always looked sad and depressed so i think jeremy is the happy one enough said,0
dude that was the most epic add read ever,0
the mask isnt an issue for why he looks inexpressive tokusatsu shows like kamenrider and super sentai have for decades managed to create expressive characters despite them being in full suits with hard masks bodylanguage carries the expressions of a masked character a good suit actor will show you the ins and outs of a character just by how he moves or holds himself when idle tobey s spiderman suit is absolutely amazing and giving it a face would take away more than it adds it still looks great after so many years,0
really funny awkward cut at gone through all this trouble to make a video worthy of this car cut i assume car is meant to be character since it gets cut in half but the video is worthy of the car anyways,0
that sponsor tho lmaooo i love it,0
toby will always be the spider man tom holland s is kind of a childish version more for kids,0
in spite of everything you ve done for them eventually they will hate you norman became just what he didnt like just what the board members did to him i totally agree,1
you re a big fan of james franco why,0
that don t tell harry line that norman said before he died in sm and peter keeping that dying wish all the way to sm really shows how much respect peter had for the man of norman and not the goblin looking like the bad guy in front of his bestfriend when he eventually finds out mad respect,1
wasn t it great when aunt may was actually old and was nice to peter and or did something important,0
if the to ei videos don t hold up you have my full support if you make different videos as in marvel,0
seeing that train scene again where the people spider man saves keep his secret and show such trust in him really hit home how much the time a movie comes out in impacts its narrative and themes in that sense of community and kindness everyone banding together to help the hero while maybe not exactly what was happening in real life felt real and believable contrast that to no way home where that kind of reaction would be utterly ridiculous in there is no way anyone would believe that a group of people could show that kindness and compassion towards someone even if again that s not quite reflective of reality but it just wouldn t be a realistic scenario anymore so both movies handle the idea of peter s identity being known incredibly differently but both so aptly for the time they re made in it s so cool,0
tobey s spider man was the spider man that introduced kids like me to heroes like him and to this day is one of my favourite movies that i watched since childhood,0
as a tobey fan this is waaaay too bias towards his films,0
the nitpick about peter s strength shouldn t be seen as a fault in the movie more a fault of the character if you have issue with it you could say the same about nearly every fight against villains peter s had in the comics because he is so freaking strong in the comics when doc ock switched bodies with peter he punched scorpion s jaw off without meaning to literally punched it clean off he could kill a normal human with one punch without even trying that s how strong he is he holds back almost every time he fights so that he doesn t risk killing them when you re that strong it could be hard to figure out how far you can go before they die from the hit without trial and error and peter is not willing to do that so he severely holds back so he doesn t kill them he could win any fight with one hit to the head and knock them out but it s a fine line hitting them hard enough to knock them out and hitting them hard enough that it kills them especially when you re so strong that you could kill them without trying at all it makes the line even thinner so he s not even coming close to hitting with his full strength in fights to be honest he s hardly hitting at all but to normal humans it feels like a full hit when the punch lands and constantly holding back your own strength like that would be exhausting but peter does it anyway even when a fight is going south he still won t give it his full strength cause he doesn t want to kill them just another reason i love spider man really,0
is that you mess with all of us guy herc from the wire,0
spider man is underrated and overhated and i will say that till the day i die,0
i just heard here in the video that ps spider man s game music,0
so the original concept for spider man was about a middle aged peter parker who became desensitized about being spider man was this idea revisited and became the inspiration for peter b parker the pieces fit together way too well edward norton even looks like a live action peter b parker,0
was wondering why the movie clips are extremely quiet and turns out it was because it s panned to the right side for some reason and i never use both earbuds at the same time,0
dude i literally just watched a video about moist critical talking about you and i didn t even notice i was watching you until i heard you say your name,1
there s still emotion in spider man even if you can t see spider man s facial expressions his body langauge shows his emotions,0
wea buena,0
watched ever second of this spot on,1
i relate to the loss and worry over mortality and coping with feelings of despair i m sorry that anyone else had to feel that way and am glad you found something in these movies you rock great video,0
harry is so underrated in these films,0
absolutely great break down you made me realize things i never did before and made me appreciate and love tobeys spiderman even more ngl made me tear up a lot more with those realizations tobey will always be my spiderman and will always be my hero thanks man and always know even through your darkest days people will always be there for each other and you because hero films although fictional will always inspire the hero in everyone and motivate people to be there for others people in the world can be the background character new york and show you there are more compassionate people than you think,0
i totally and respectfully disagree he s a superhero and he s spider man with a helmet on is that not awesome iron man has one and i feel like mj in this trilogy was a huge bitch,0
when mentioning strength it is all because spider man s strength is proportionate to the situation he is in the stakes stress and all that yk that s what i chalk it up to,0
,0
thank you for pointing out doc oc surviving spidey punches was weird as that had bothered me for years since,1
finally some love for aunt may mary jane harry osborn and spiderman in general,1
supaidaman was the best one,0
i m gonna have to hard disagree on the mask rant here but i enjoyed the rest of the video,0
spider man still my favorite,1
your american accent in the g fuel ad really earnestly sounded like a matpat narration and i loved it congrats on winning out against toei,0
i agree her performance as aunt may always stuck with me just for how relatable and real she felt as a character she reminded me of my grandparents specifically my grandaunt who passed away years ago which made it more personal in fact since my native language is spanish i watched the movies in spanish dub and the performance of her voice over just made me care more for her thanks to her actions and voice making her seem like my own sweet older aunt i just thank rosemary so much for bringing a really relatable parent figure to this trilogy,1
an edward norton spiderman movie is something i didn t think i d ever want yet here we are,0
raimi movies mcu,0
i take your point about the mask limiting face acting i think a decent compromise would have been if they saved the helmet for action scenes where tobey is constantly swapping with stunt doubles and they give him a more flexible mask for acting shots although they do a decent job breaking the mask a lot in his fight scenes so that a little more can always come through,0
my favorite spider man is josh keaton quite spectacular,0
those ppl who didn t supported andrew then do you have to say anything now,1
oh what a surprise another something male fanboying about the first sam raimi sm films and neglecting to explore their many weaknesses so original but i do want to say thank you for a much more balanced analysis of sm,1
when i was re watching the movies before nwh came out and came across the aunt may speech scene i had to pause the movie because i was balling my eyes out and i have to agree i think it s something a lot of people need to hear and there is nothing to be ashamed of,0
concerning the mask i have mixed feeling on this matter while i think it would be cool to see more features it s really not possible to genuinely see emotion from that like what r we gonna see the outline of his mouth smile frown or open in shock or his brow line dip down when he s angry or focused maybe if the mask is straight up silk but what u hope for to see some clear sign of emotion isn t really possible for a character with a mask like this the closest well get to that is toms mask but i ll be honest i think toms lens like eyes r v corny tbh toms entire costume design is by far the worst of them all in my opinion which is ironic considering the immense capabilities of it on a completely other note i m super excited to see toms new suit in the next movie from the frames captured at the end of nwh it looks very promising we might get the costume that hits the nail on the head for accurately encapsulating comic book spider man,0
it really goes to show that the villians aren t pure evil they are humans that fell victim to trama and unfortunately circumstances and lashes out from it,0
not gonna lie not only spidey raimi helped me appreciate the other spidey films but also that one horror film drag me to hell,0
i think it s ironic how your andrew garfield films video has the most views best spider man,0
i think otto himself must have gained a measure of super strength and invulnerability along with his arms in the explosion that created him simply because we see him constantly get hit moreso in the comics or webbed in the face so often and it s usually just a minor annoyance he also apparently hits pretty hard with his human arms too,1
are you gonna review into the spider verse,1
i d like to think the reason the train people didn t reveal his identity like not even fucking person is because they see how fucking beat up he was after he saved them like he didn t have to do that he just could and did,0
i agree with so much of this analysis but i think i come from a different perspective when it comes to the suit that tobey dons in this trilogy i grew up on power rangers mainly the original saban era that most fans generally think is the best stretch of the series and those helmets are completely hard there s no way to see the facial expressions of the characters however those characters tended to use a lot more physical movement to show their movement not the ridiculous head bobbing you d see in mmpr seasons sort of like what you d see from andrew garfield s iteration of the character so i don t think the problem stems from the mask not allowing for emotion to resonate through but the lack of physical movement to help sell certain emotions,1
mary jane was a jealous hag and a cheater,1
thanks for blessing us with this masterpiece about to watch the andrew garfield video,0
was that tom in the gfule add lollllll tom i miss you make some content you beautiful sack of shit,0
toby andrey tom is my list from best to worsy,0
mark this video has touched me in such a profound way like a lot of people i ve had a rough couple years so i went back to everything that i loved as a kid for comfort spider man has consistently been the thing i can always go back to and have a great time especially this trilogy your experience with the aunt may hero speech was similar to mine and hearing it spoken out loud broke me a little bit in a good way of course rosemary harris in these movies affects me in a way nothing else could ever hope to touch she along with everything spider man is about inspires hope and hope s not a thing i come by too often these days thank you for making this video and i hope you have a great rest of your day,1
about the train fight nitpick iirc the novelization for this movie states that in that fight doc ock was on the verge of passing out that s why he broke the train and ran away,0
this video gave me so many emotions,0
tobey is spider man and sam rami needs his flowers,0
in the comics spiderman kids things that weighs tons but never knocks anyone out in one punch unless they re just random robbers or something like that spiderman always severly holds back,0
so that thing about peter pulling his punches has been a thing thats come up even in the comics superior spiderman is a bit where doc ock has taken over peters brain and is spiderman for a bit he takes on the mantle starts doing the crimefighting thing and just about murders the first dude he finds with one punch octavious has a bit of a moment where hes there looking at the dude he decked and thinking spiderman could have done worse than this to me times over if he had a bad day he could have killed me and he never did,0
i love all the spiderman movies but tom holland s interpretation currently is what i consider to be the closest we get to comic spidey in terms of both spider man and peter,0
mask argument dumb,0
not a bad person just had bad luck i ve for most of my life have had a strange soft spot for thieves although i hate it when i see videos of people doing such repulsive actions but now i have a revelation that it might have come from sandman all those years ago cause for every thief that steals foe themselves is someone that does what they do for someone other than themselves not that i m saying stealing is justified it never is all i m saying is there s always more than one side to every story,0
i don t consider sandman a villain at all it makes it even more messed up when peter straight up murders him i was rooting for sandman that movie tbh meanwhile peter is all over the place and definitely the main villain,0
that explanation better defines superman rather than spiderman,0
rosemary harris performance as may is honestly one of if not my favourite part of these films and in spider man during her speech to peter about there being a hero in everyone i think it s safe to say she knows he s spider man or at that moment was spider man but gave up she knows he quit she senses his troubles and she offers the best advice that anyone could give to him in his lowest point and while it s never explicitly stated that she ever knew it s pretty clear now that we think about it about what she s learned about him such as his part in ben s death and she not only forgives him but continues to do her best to elevate him in spite of that and it works,1
r i p totally not grandma,0
i really want to see jake gyllenhaal as spiderman too as different spidy from other earth,0
ngl i wasn t a fan of mj in tobey maguire films,1
there was a comic that adresses the strength thing where it s revealt that spiderman is so strong that in battle he has to focus on not murdering his opponents with every punch essentially he could knock the bad guy out but would risk killing them i m guessing that s not true in this film and would contradict many other comics but i found it a neat reveal,0
i understand that most people aren t exactly crazy about the relationship drama between peter and mj but i can t help but wonder if that was done for a reason perhaps to show how their personal flaws and emotional immaturity doesn t quite make them as compatible as they were hoping they would be we see this particularly in mj wants someone who will understand her and listen leading her to briefly gravitate towards harry whereas peter is more concerned about enjoying himself now that things are going well for him for once and considering how the movies have implied that peter is more in love with the idea of being with mj than mj herself this is seriously something that needed to be addressed and i think that s what the third movie was trying to do,0
i actually like the face being still reminds me of master chief loved character and we ve never seen his face,1
beautiful video,0
imo the first film was the best,0
tobey maguire is spider man for an entire generation of people that were kids in the early s,0
are amazing but sorry no is a dumpster fire too much going on sh t character development dialogue and too much ret conning of previous movies emotional punches,0
at least in the comic books spiderman does not usually kick with his full power because he kinda does not want to be a serial killer mutilator,0
your breakdowns of the spiderman movies are fire bro,0
maybe everytime otto gets punched the arms knock him back to consciousness,0
in my opinion what makes tobey maguire s version of spider man the greatest is the relatability of the struggles,1
spiderman and pirates of the caribbean came out the same weekend in hindsight i do enjoy spiderman but when i had to pick i chose pirates,1
spiderman had good ideas that weren t executed properly due to that studio interference sam raimi did the best he could with that interference limiting him which is why some of the stuff you mentioned is present but it doesn t make the movie not a mess it has some amazing scenes like sandman being created but all put together in the movie don t work quite so well,0
god damm dude this is a masterpiece of a review,0
its scarily simmilar how your life has been to mine april my grandma died of covid and liver failure never got to say goodbye october my dad got lymphnode cancer luckily he was recently declared cured,0
i love the third movie,0
norman and goblin are different people,0
maybe doc ock doesn t get knocked out not just because of pulling punches but because the tentacles keep him awake somehow idk like how crack heads keep getting up after getting beat up tazed,0
mj is just the least likeable love interest to me they had some moments and i liked them when i was young but looking back it was just off i remember watching it thinking why do they react so slowly why does every line sound like reading a fanfic somebody had better crack a dumb joke and laugh and of course there s the question of fidelity i understand shifting emotions and and bad timing and going back and forth but i feel like what they had wasn t special enough to warrant that much drama it felt like mary jane loved spider man and wanted the attention peter gave her and it felt like tobey s peter liked mj because she s pretty i didn t see enough rapport or chemistry anyway i m now team gwen forever,0
i hate that people focus on mary jane s flaws she cheated on harry because he was a lousy boyfriend good as a friend tho she cheated on john because she d been pining over peter for years to no avail she cheated on peter in a moment of weakness because peter s been neglecting her she s sweet and resilient despite her dad s treatment towards her and kirsten is a lovely mj the writing for women isn t great on these movies but to hyper fixate on their flaws erases her as a whole person that s consistent in flaws and virtues idk i m not great at words,0
even though i respect the opinion portrayed in this video i fully disagree with it you bring up a lot of valid points but to me the problem is that even though these points exist they coexist with the extreme cringe created in the stories as well that frankly just ruins the setup when you watch it obviously spider man is the biggest offender when it comes to this but the other had plenty of it as well you say that you enjoy them more now that you rewatched them i d go as far as to say that the reason people like them is because they havent rewatched it it just lives on nostalgia oh and spider man had too many characters there is no way of defending it they are all poorly written and the movie is a hot mess it isnt just because venom is lackluster i get that people prefer tobey over tom because toms spider man is written to be more of a comic relief occasionally a bit daft and easier to digest but that does not make tobeys portrayal good it just fills a niche that toms doesnt,0
when doc ok s mind goes into spider man body in the superior spidey saga he quickly realized how parker always held back when fighting him for he could always have killed him with a single punch if he wanted to,0
toby maguire was shit as spider man the villains and aunt may carried the films,0
rip andrew garfield andrew s actually good,1
this is a well made video,0
subbed this was brilliant great work,0
can we talk about how brutal both toby and the andrew spider mans were people died dude just watch a clip of dr octo waking up with his tentacle arms for the first time in the clinic that scene is basically a horror scene fucking insane in the amazing spider man well do i need to say more people die like rats people have holes punched into them i m not hating on the current marvel movies but it really does make you appreciate these movies more once again not hating just disappointed in the current marvel s and tom hollands spider man it s not about the actor or how they wrote him cause it works within his own universe but frankly they themselves opened up to the other works of spider man then tom hollands spider man loses the beauty contest horribly it s not just about the the brutality of it but the artistic routes those films go down marvel movies basically have none of that,0
i accepted tom hollands character i really did but then they put that kid next to tobby and andrew nah dude his hihi haha character doesn t stand a chance altough i see a chance for that to change in the future but as of now i don t think that is anything other then recency bias,0
personal opinion tobey andrew tom,1
i get your point and i agree somewhat but i think the expressionless mask helps him keep his identity secret like if spider man had a long nose sharp chin and big ears distinct features people who know peter would figure it out eventually,0
i haven t seen you go this off the rails since the emperor pilaf rap oh i crying right now xdxdxdxdxdxdxd,0
very good video,0
people form their opinions on these films and versions of spiderman on nostalgia and that is fair but honestly as good as the raimi films are i really don t think they re as good as people hype them up to be and it s the opposite with the garfield ones people hate them because they weren t like the original version they grew up with,0
how old is this amazing man,0
this is probably one of the best videos i ve seen in a while it went back so fast,0
the mask thing is unavoidable how could they remove or change the mask without fundamentally changing the character not worth complaining much about in my opinion also i love the andrew garfield spidey movies even though they s ck he s probably my top favorite actor alive today and as an aspiring writer those movies are an excellent case study of what not to do i really hope they bring him back and do it right next time i ve loved spidey ever since i was a little kid reading my dad s huge vintage comic collection thanks for all the great spidey content,0
i love his spider man mask the helmet doesn t take away anything,0
you are not a bad person dattebayo,0
mark should review the whole mcu lol,0
about spider man being able to knock out doc ock yup that s even addressed in the comics when doc ock switches bodies with spider man he has a fight with scorpion where spider man rips scorpion s jaw off with a fist it made doc realize just how much he s been holding back throughout their fights over the years,0
this is why i will always say the toby movies will always be my favorite the character development and the dialogue of course with a bit of nostalgia,1
venom has a undiefed character in the movie venom mixes with peter parker to make a more self interested aggresive peter parker,0
green goblin is my favorite movie villian,0
congrats on a million views on this one bud well deserved,0
andrew so far is i think the most believable and realistic version of peter i ve seen he s not stereotypical nerdy like maguires peter was and instead felt like how i was back in highschool as well as my friends we had dates and had fun but we still got bullied too and all of us were absolutely very nerdy just because he didn t portray peter the same way maguire did doesn t mean it shouldn t be believable it was just modern on top of that maguires peter was very much a new version as the comics version was nothing like his andrews and tom s are both much closer to how comic book peter is he was a bully victim that would have been a bully himself if given the power that s the character stan lee and steve ditko made and that s what andrew and tom were portraying considering how much fans care about faithfulness to the source material for every other comic book character it s hilarious to me that fans make an exception for the one character that makes such a huge departure likely because of nostalgia similar to how older batman fans do for michael keaton s batman in even though he uses guns and kills people especially since fans had a problem with this in batman v superman,0
fantastic video your passion for this fantasy wold was an absolute pleasure to watch,0
that was one of the few times i didn t skip a youtube sponsor that was incredible,0
yuri lowenthal is still my favorite spider man,0
i agree that the aunt may in the second film hit so hard to me too and spiderman means a lot to me too let s keep pushing forward mark,0
i think all iterations of spiderman are good spider man is still one of my favorite spiderman movies,0
loved the mr sunday movies shoutout,0
tobey is the goat,1
the review aside holy shit the cinematography of that g fuel ad i fully believe now that a totally not mark spiderman trilogy could be a thing,1
if youre interested id really enjoy your take on the different batman movies or the dceu after youre done with marvel also that might be the funniest ad ive seen in a video,0
haven t heard that noise in a long time lol,0
pls make a g fuel cinematic universe,0
wait sam raimi the guy who directed evil dead who s famous for b movie horror doesnt like venom venom the violent symbiote with a potent for eating human brains who manipulates peter parker and ostensibly takes over the body of eddie brock who would look amazing if portrayed like a horror movie monster my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,0
before i watch your video i feel like these spiderman films are what eventually led to the entire mcu,1
i think that new goblin is the most misunderstood character in the trilogy i really wish he got more screen time like raimi intended before the studio got involved venom was not great but neither is tom hardy s version maybe the mcu will get it right some day,0
the big question isn t why spidey didn t knock doc ock out with a single punch the real question is how come all this civilian turned villains are suddenly martial arts experts norman osborne octavius eddie brock dr connors etc,0
i m not sure if anybody s noticed but there s a poster of smokin joe frazier at details details d,0
i agree the first trilogy was and is the best nd was a joke and the current soon to be trilogy is meh current one is meh because it feels like a side story to the avengers does not really feel like a spiderman series to me those feel like an expansion it s like playing the witcher expansions without playing the actual game sure you can play it it looks and feels good but to truly experience it you need to play the rest same with these lots of references to the other movies ironman almost turning spiderman into his sidekick all these combined take from the story and spiderman s character are we to believe that in the same movie verse where the avengers fought loki s army and almost had to sacrifice tony to repel them no one is keeping tabs on the technology of those aliens and that they can just steal it worse thing are we to believe that the only one who can resolve the issue is spiderman when the world they depicted in the previous movies has so many other superheroes all eager to help i find that extremely hard to believe almost impossible imagine how the first ironman movie would have been if hawkeye and black widow would have busted him out of the cave lackluster right what they should have done is introduce spiderman before he met the other heroes before tony said i am ironman before everyone knew of the other superheroes the original trilogy had it all right maybe not for everyone but for me at least it did the poll shown in the beginning of the video made me happy to realize that i am not alone in this belief,0
was all i ever needed to hear to be able to fully know how to sacrifice and be responsible and move on for almost years i ve ignored it because i thought i was doing the right thing and sticking to the thing that s most important to me when in reality i was supposed to do the right thing and give it up and move on sometimes in life you can hear from hundreds of people who are telling you hundreds of speeches on how and why you need to do the right thing and yet it never clicks all it takes is one good line to make you understand it more clear and finally be able to do it thank you for making this video this is literally going to change my life i just hope i m not too late like dr otto octavius,0
,0
it s tough to watch such an overly biased review,0
toby best,1
bro that made me cry from,1
joey diaz sighting he s the real hero,0
modern super hero cartoons make spider man out to be an immature child but that is not how he is,1
i always felt andrew garfield was the best spider man by acting alone but i think raimi was the best director out of all of them for some reason the other two just fall short and i think where my problem is with those directors is they don t have a clear artistic style like raimi jon watts and marc webb s films just seem very undercooked in that a lot of the characters aren t explored enough those movies don t feel as emotional as the raimi films do and this is why i think the raimi films are better yeah the later films have better visual effects and technology but that alone doesn t qualify it to be a better film,0
definitely getting a sub the content quality is incredible and you simply don t get boring after a long amount of time making it so easy to watch great takes on the movies and keep up the good work,1
tobey maguire is the best spider man of all time all these other spider man actors are not as good as toby take it from me that s somebody who grew up with watching all three spider man movies in the early s,1
classic meme,0
i like spider man but for me it ll always be spider man i m probably the only person on earth who has that opinion,1
sometimes i feel like the actors should ve designed the spider man outfits so it can feel like theirs,0
i didn t think a lot of people liked him as much as me so i m happy,0
i bet spider man couldn t knock out doc ock because the ai of the arms kept him conscious and or kept waking him up as soon as he became unconscious spoilers but in no way home we see that when he s cured doc ock says it s so quiet i ve almost forgotten which tells us that the arms were literally talking to doc ock or at least giving him voices in his head but also even if he was knocked out the arms would still keep fighting and carrying him around because they re independently intelligent as we ve seen during the hospital scene,0
the green goblin looking thicc,0
really great recap i wonder how you d like the editor s cut of spider man since it contains a lot of character driven scenes not unlike spider man harry is also convinced to rejoin peter after seeing a broken picture of him peter and mj as opposed to his butler s admission which realistically he may have already knew,0
the best moment at s,0
i also didn t like spider man when i saw it in theatres when i was but now i have a new appreciation for it even if some of it s concepts fell flat the mcu simply doesn t have the balls to do what that movie did with it s characters,0
i too lost my grandmother last year without being able to say goodbye and about months ago i lost my father as well to cancer your speech about what you went through nearly drove me to tears with how relatable it was i now take care of my mom and the added responsibility has been draining to say the least but it has brought out a deep inner strength that i never knew i had the part about there being a hero in all of us hit deep it was something i needed to hear thank you mark,1
with all these reviews and comments i ve seen surrounding the trilogy i have noticed that spider man s critical standing has slightly improved over the years i always liked it and i love the fact that some people started appreciating it more p s good work mark,1
so nobody is going to talk about the music at i got what you did,0
in my opinion andrew is the best,0
excellent video and wonderfully articulated thoughts it makes me very happy too to see these movies getting some much needed love i can t help but feel that because of s flaws the whole trilogy became relegated to memehood and only the negative aspects of the films were remembered and the sentiment that they were bad just kept being repeated mindlessly all while the positive aspects were overlooked those being the humanity and beauty of the stories they told humanity and beauty of which you spoke of so eloquently bravo bravo,1
totally not mark i m sorry for the sudden loss of your grandmother and the other events you faced it is hard and you are a total chad asauras rex for pulling through and creating great videos like this i m also sorry for your videos getting pulled from your channel but keep it up you are a great youtube and great person,0
i loved doc ock the most out of the raimi villains he is a great sympathetic villain a generally good person finally falls to his dark impulses then realizes that it was wrong to do so he sacrifices himself to make up for his misdeeds and goes out once again a good person,1
im sorry but this whole bit of we get to know these people is bullshit and just riding raimi s dick for the sake of it please please tell me how a single line of dialogue in the train scene holds more weight than single line of dialogue in the ferry scene i m dying to know as someone who also grew up watching these films i m so fucking tired of people giving it unearned praise know we do not get to know the people on the train there s one guy that makes one sarcastic comment and that s it the focus is on peter just like in homecoming s ferry scene yall actively actively ruin the love i had for these films in my childhood by dick riding them so much,0
now we need a no way home review,0
spidey should ve been one villain tobey rejecting venom which then goes to osbourne jr who learns spidey is tobey then final battle no need for sandman or topher,0
i for some reason always laugh when green goblins oh comes out of his mouth,0
just so you know every time spider man hit doc oc he would actually be knocked out but the tentacles would wake him up saying stuff like father wake up and father give us instructions this si in the offical novilisation of spider man,0
whilst i do enjoy the first sam raimi spider man and it s sequel even more my only real problem is how mary jane watson and her and peter s relationship is portrayed mj feels more like a typical damsel in distress and doesn t get anything to do at all this is not the fault of kirsten dunst it is the script to blame the constant back and forth with her and peter gets annoying sometimes too with peter going about how he can t be with mj because of her being in danger despite the fact that she was in danger a lot of times and that the reason for her being in danger was not because she knew his secret identity and mj in the second film seemingly using her fianc to try and get peter to try harder in getting her affection say what you will about the garfield spider man movies at least gwen stacy was more useful instead of screaming all the damn time,0
something ive always wondered about the reimi spiderman movies does may secretly know peter is spiderman without telling peter,0
every introverts room well you got the crying corner you got sadness closet you got the happiness desk you got the almost inches of fan fiction you got pain you got hate and you got escaping reality rectangle,0
the first movie norman and peter are protagonist i like to look at it as their antagonist for one another a protagonist doesn t inherently have to be the good guy the main character the antagonist is just someone who opposes the protagonist,0
tobey maguire childhood memories the real spiderman,1
spidey being able massively holding back on his opponents is something touched on in the books and comics when your able to punch a hole through concrete it doesn t take much to kill someone spiderman body gets taken over and the possessor nearly kills someone in a fight without trying and is shocked at his strength despite fighting spiderman many times so while it s a bit silly cannoncially there is a reason for it,1
keep up the great work my man,0
nothing beats god speed spider man oh,0
this is what i like to see i loved spidey in theaters and i love it to this day it was much simpler than the first two but it s a comic book movie to me seeing sandman s origin was kinda redundant because as soon as i saw the stripes i knew him personally same with venom it can be seen as bad writing or intentionally simple for smaller kids,1
there was an innocence purity to tobeys spiderman he was a geek with a heart of gold i d love to see him back in the role,1
i loved all of the movies i know people didn t love but i think it s great,1
jeez that was a ride man so glad that i found your channel,0
mark thank you for becoming a hero to a lot of us with your own abilities you have been able to bring back childhood memories in many of us and portray the brillance of many series at such a consistent rate and quality i have watched countless amouny of analysis type of videos but yours stand out in an incredible way your team and you have become my most favorite content these past years when i needed it the most you have already impacted a lot of people and you have already started to mark your own heroic legacy,1
j jonah jameson,0
will you review and defend star wars prequels,0
true been told it s after the amazing spider man i start to appreciate sam raimi s spider man,0
i like andrew s one the most but i think it s mostly because i watched the amazing spiderman movies so often when i was young but of course all three are great edit okay i just saw the first amazing spiderman and now i rewatched one but i still kinda liked it xd,1
fuck no way home spider man is the best spider man movie,0
holy shit that g fuel sponsor was amazing literally grabbed my attention to watch it all,0
your comment about the masks muffling the performance of the actors is spot on i ve been of the opinion since i watched no way home that removing the goblins mask so we could see willem dafoe s actual acting chops made the character sooooooo much better and more compelling i think if you re going to go that route you don t want a mask that hinders the actors expressions one of the reasons the joker works as a villain in most of his adaptions is because he s got a mask on in a sense by using paint but you can see every single little emotion the actors are trying to convey just imagine if health ledgers joker was wearing a mask like the goblins or spider man it would have completely ruined the character,0
the gfuel ads tho,1
my right ear thanks you for the film audio xd,0
just watched this fully love it,0
hey mark there s this hot ones interview where tom holland actually addresses the limitations of a mask in being able to express himself and talks about how he tries to work around that,1
and now we have no way home one of the best movies of all time in general,0
spiderman is more of a saver than a fighter his strength skills are most focused when he s saving people because he really doesn t like beating people up and hurting it s not really peter parker s thing because he s a nice and forgiving person this is why when he s venom or he s being a douchebag for whatever reason he throws way harder bunches because he let the focus of his strength move from saving people to hurting others this is why he can lift incredible objects when he s saving people because he likes saving people and focuses his powers and strength on doing such and why he can t really punch extremely hard unless he s mad or something because he doesn t like hurting people even if they re villains as he s a nice dude so he doesn t focus his powers or strength to punch as much as to save this is just my theory why he can t knock doc out but he can still stop the train and lift crap and stuff like dat,0
spiderman is boring to me i ll never see how everyone loves it so much,0
it s funny how andrew is the best spider man but tobey is the best peter parker and tom is the best uh,0
and if you say tobeys suit is bad im disliking this,0
um its years not dumb,0
he wears a mask for a reason of course it s meant to shield his face and hide his identity,0
i love that throughout these movies dr connors is missing an arm so he s already set up to become the lizard,0
toby is best,0
hey man if you get ripped for a role you d probably want to consume some unhealthy food when you re done pizza time,0
spiderman is the best movie,0
the mask is good fam leave it alone,0
i voted andrew,1
so much people dont like andrew seriously percent,0
i love the old one,0
i love that one all them,0
there s really no middle point between faceshell and no faceshell lack of faceshell completely kills look of the suit,0
xd,1
seeing his point of view on the suits makes me think how he s going to be so happy with the ending of no way home,0
expressions or not the toby costume is so sleek and makes sense the cgi things just look cartoonish and for makimg money,1
ty,0
because of how great andrew garfield was in spider man no way home he probably a lot higher up now,0
why is the audio mostly on the right channel,0
everyone asks who is the best spider man but to me what matters more is which movies are better and i would say that the others haven t come close to the original trilogy,0
i loved spiderman,1
when i think of aunt may i always picture rosemary instantly that s not to say that the other ones don t do just fine in their respective universes but she is by far the most aunt may of them all the others don t really factor into the stories as much either,1
i missed the part where this is my problem,0
poor andrew hes so underated,1
toby miguire,1
andrew honestly gets too much hate he was a great spider man i still like him better than tom although this new movie made me like tom s spider man a bit,1
i literally watched the whole video because of all scenes of spiderman,0
i lost my grandmother to cancer a heart attack in march of i felt my own version of everything you described i sympathize with you,0
that nd brilliant but lazy line spoken by doc ock always makes me smile,0
i just realised i pretty much well up at every scene of aunt may s in spiderman every time i watch it what an absolute performance from her,1
to think that eric forman is actually venom wow such a twist to that s show,0
i love these movies to death but i just can t take them seriously enough to look at them in such a critical way they ride this strange line for me where i think they re comedy gold but it s really hard to tell how much of it is intentional even scenes where it s most likely not like goblins death i still find hilarious because of the way it s shot and edited i mean with cuts in the span of about seconds it just comes off as silly but i love it for that my enjoyment mostly comes from watching these movies in a so bad it s good kind of way so it s just really hard to judge them by a normal movie standard,0
i think the rd movie has always been good obviously messy though i never saw the cartoons and didnt know who venom was before the movie it makes sense why people didn t like it now,0
mark please reply to my comment i love your channel i hope you have a merry christmas,0
i saw more emotion through toby playing spiderman specifically in that elevator scene than kirsten dunst playing mj in all movies she was terrible in the trilogy,0
fuck toei lol,1
i never knew the first scene of him climbing on the wall was cgi,0
lol new york a look out hoooo here comes the spider man,0
i can appreciate your positiviry towards i liked it when i was young and figured i wouldn t like it much nowt but it s still a fun film albeit heavily flawed i don t know if you ignored the flaws or just wanted to showcase the film in a more positive light i can honestly say spider man has flat out terrible antagonists harry s arc is completely ruined by the amnesia being sidelined by vemon and the convenience behind his butler never mentioning that he knew peter didn t kill norman sandman needed to have peter s origin retconned just to give the character relevance in the story and how many fucking times do we need to see the locket we get it he s a criminal because he wants to provide for his dying daughter he wasn t fleshed out enough because he shared the movie with two other villains and venom was shoehorned in,0
canceling this movie series was probably the worst thing that has happened to the super hero community say what you will about the rd movie and you can say that the mcu is mainstream and all that but never before or after the raimi trilogy has a super hero franchise had the same feel to it commercials dedicated to it kids and adults alike talking about the recent movie for months in person to each other and actively speculating what they ll do next it brought a sense of unity that i haven t felt since even the mcu hasn t brought that to me,1
can we talk about the mini sun going into the ocean and what this would actually do,0
jesus looking at peter combing down his hair was the reason i did that at the time,0
so many movies base on the drama of the us having a bad healthcare system,0
i would like to thank you for rating these movies and giving these movies and characters the respect they deserve,1
you do too much you re not superman you know,0
toby is my favorite and i need to say something people who say the rami movies are bad is dumb and they are kinda dumb but like we all love and but we forget that,0
also if you haven t get spider man the movie on psp it s surprisingly awesome to watch that way,0
i am not gonna lie seeing spider man on my th birthday may th was a great experience i still loved spider man and still love it it still hits home though it doesn t hold up like the others to me and it s not because of venom lol,1
wow i never cry during reviews but you hit me home i may not have lost my grandma too recently but i too lost her to cancer in rosemary harris as aunt may too reminds me of a combo of her and my great grandma thank you for bringing me memories of my beloved inspiring grandmas they are still in my heart as is your grandma to you they are our heroes,1
wait he did wait you can fire your founder,0
,0
are you the guy that got videos taken down in like ten mins,0
my opinion is that tobey is the best spiderman andrew has the best new york tom is the best peter parker,0
who s watching after no way home,0
there s a comic where doc oc and peter switch bodies oc decided to fight a guy and blew his head off with a single punch his next line was and i quote holy shit i m lucky spiderman pulls his punches,0
,0
he too can be defined by a single quote get last minute gifts at dick sporting goods,0
this video is perfect to watch before the new movie,0
,1
we need a no way home video now,0
we support you mark keep up the good work,0
harry s smile in this movie is very infectious every time he s happy it s difficult to not smile as well,1
your work and dedication towards your videos are truly amazing your analysis are something else incredible job man greetings from italy,1
i m and was also disappointed when venom didn t get any action in spiderman no way home,0
andrew is my favorite but tobey is the best spider man and the strongest,0
i m curious to see your opinion on spider man ps and spider man miles morales ps,0
watching this after watching no way home hits hard i get goosebumps thinking about how much these characters mean to us,0
good video i hope you are okay,1
this man managed to change my perception and thoughts on spider man in terms of themes and examining with great power there must also come great responsibility the rami films are in fact a perfect trilogy it s bittersweet but i m kind of glad we got three great character analysis from rami godspeed indeed spider man,1
rent,0
tobey was is will be the best,1
i ve always and forever favor tobey s spider man it s just pure amazing,1
spider man is my most nostalgic movie since i was literally when it came out i know the first are better since rewatching now but holy seeing venom for the first time as a kid was so cool,0
totally not mark i hope you read this this is the most well put together well thought out well written video essay i think i might have ever seen for something like a film or film series officially or not this is so good i truly believe it should be immortalized as much as the films this video is about like this should be shown to kids in school or want to be future directors and writers as a model of what makes storytelling good not just because of how well the source material lined it up for you but that you recognized every single bit of it and neatly wrapped it all up i consider this hugely important and i only hope someday it will be put in a time capsule or like the historical entertainment library vault thing or whatever fantastic job liked subscribed i just wish i could hand you my whole wallet,0
i can see the problem of peters strength capabilities and how it s like weird he can t just knock otto pretty easily but it s because peter has to be really careful with his strength in the comics it s been shown that if he s just startled and goes a bit overboard he can kill someone and i m pretty sure peter doesnt want to kill otto especially when he probably thinks he can still be a good man,0
on the point of otto being just a normal man and shouldn t be able to take all of those punches we know the metal arms are the ones controlling otto after the chip is fried so the reason can simply be that the arms are blocking any pain receptors in otto s brain pumping him full of adrenaline and overall making it so he has to keep fighting peter whether he physically should be able to or not,0
we are with you good luck mark,0
in suit idk man my favorite is andrew s,0
andrew garfield,1
man when you said the part about aunt may reminding you of your grandma i felt that in my soul i always felt like she was my grandma,0
hello i don t know if you will be reading this but i think that in the novelization of spiderman is explained that otto used some serum like norman s in order of even being able to manage the pain that getting the arms connected to him would cause,0
on your note about tobey being emotionless in the suit tom holland found a solution to this actually what he does is use his body and hand movements when inside the suit so cus you never see his mouth so his body does the talking,1
tbh i ll always miss your toei stuff but tbh fuck toei them stopping you from making anything they re associated with makes me sick rip the blind naruto run i ve been looking forward to that for years,0
spider man responsibility spider man consequences spider man choice,1
man mark i think this might be my fave video of yours and seeing it the day after no way home made hit extra hard i legit started tearing up and i m glad to see a video treating these films with respect and not just saying they suck for views,1
best video,1
i cane here to watch a reveiw buy instead i got taught a lesson,0
i love this there is not a single dislike on this video,0
omg i will always have so many great memories from the st one,0
i guess one person can make a difference the watcher stan the man,0
video had me in tears,0
people still likes andrew over the others,1
if venom was teased for say spiedy and they kept the suit that would have been better,0
w,0
i don t know if you ve seen no way home yet so i ll just say this i used to not like tobey maguires portrayal as peter i loved him as a kid but once i got into the comics and saw the character peter always was i felt cheated like a great character had been robbed from me this is ultimately why despite the hate he once got i ve always held andrew garfield as my favorite version of peter parker as far as i m concerned he is peter for me the same snarky jokey somewhat arrogant asshole that i d loved reading about and playing as in video games for years had finally come to life and i absolutely loved it tom holland is great as well feeling a bit like a merging of maguire and garfield but still having his own unique spark in there too but no way home has allowed me to finally to look back at maguires peter and feel better about it like it s a not so good portrayal to me but it s not the worst thing ever i ve come full circle and made peace with it now i can comfortably say that i like all of them for different reasons,1
mark in the comics doc oc took over peter s body and killed opponents way too easily than what he thought he would and then with time he realized that peter doesn t believe in killing and that he went very easy on doc oc to spare his life and slowly turned into a better person leading him to become the new peter parker hero peter didn t want to go too hard so he wouldn t hurt doc oc which is why he didn t knock doc oc out it s okay that you didn t know,0
just my opinion but i really don t like these films i think most of the actors are cringe and are pretty cheesy a lot of people then say ye but it s nostalgic it s the original but that doesn t mean it has to be good because it was the first remember these are just my opinions,0
the new aunt may has been completely butchered now she s flirting with tony stark dating with his fat chauffeur and giving no guidance to peter whatsoever mcu completely trashed her character in the holland movies,1
wow mark don t take it the wrong way but i didn t expect such a deep review of all those films you really made me relive these momenst once more and i thank you for that,1
very cool mark i hope the toei animation situation clears for you soon,1
fun fact some of you love spider man but that also means you hate him let me explain some people love only a certain live action version of spider man like just an example some think tobey maguire was the only good spider man or andrew is,1
favorite trilogy of spider,1
the editor s cut of spider man did help the film but it was still far from perfect,1
on the topic of the mask i agree that one of of the character s biggest attributes is his humanity but we get to see a lot of that through peter i remember reading something about the reasons why certain heroes wear what they wear take batman for example he wears a cowl in the shape of a bat but we can see the bottom half of his face and or partially his eyes the reason for this is because he wants to inflict fear upon his enemies he wants them to know who their up against whereas someone like spiderman wants to hide his fears from his enemies therefore he covers his whole face also the raimi films in particular did something that we just don t see as much in the other movies suit battle damage raimi movies his mask costume is all torn apart by end of the third acts with his mask being torn exposing half his face you get to see those emotions if anything this shows his humanity more this shows that he s willing to go to extreme lengths to keep his friends family and his city safe anyway that s all i wanted to say about the costume issue great video,0
nope tom is,0
finally someone who understands spider man s intentions,1
i m really glad you put such emphasis on the there s a hero in all of us speech that has stuck with me since i first heard it and i tear up every damn time i hear those words although it s not directly linked to this video or these movies i also loved the scene in spiderverse where miles buys the mask and asks what if it doesn t fit and the store owner of course none other than stan lee himself responds it always fits eventually doesn t have the same emotionality to it but i think that s a moment that s often overlooked and carries a similar sentiment,1
finally someone not slandering mary jane,0
man tobey maguire was the best spiderman ever tom is wack and i dont even know the other guys name lol i watched no way home wow i got so emotional and all the memories came back to me,0
i can see it he said the thing,0
wow this was the best retrospective of the sam raimi spider man trilogy i have ever seen so much passion and love for the films was exude in this video i only watched spiderman once i was a teen back then that grew up with the s animated series and hated what they did to venom i have to watch it again with an open mind next time,1
who watched no way home,0
hi,0
hi,0
circus in town,0
what s with the get up chump,0
looks like the freak wants to play,0
tobey is the best spider man,0
bro what am amazing reviewer i never sit down to watch these kinds of videos but you had me i skipped the segment of part but might get back to it someday i never liked that part but still you re great at these reviews wow,0
i m a year older than you and was affected in a very similar way by these films with the exception of loving unironically from my first viewing,0
who s your favorite flash thompson,0
my favorite spider man is andrew garfield but without a doubt the best ever spider man is tobey maguire,1
mark diametrically opposed my mind foes,0
garfield was a good spiderman shafted by bad movies all three were excellent tbh,0
you cant see his emotions that is what makes the suit great,1
spiderman is the best,0
no spoilers but i just saw no way home and it just spectacular enough said,0
i do get the thing with the mask but how would you fix this issue because if the helmet wasn t there there would be much bigger problems in production compared to this small detail but a great point none the less,0
you need to redo that poll now that no way home is out i think you would get a very different answer,1
norman says that the people below spiderman exist to lift him up and in an ironic twist his point is proven in a way he would have never expected the people of new york do always lift peter up time and time again in the movies,0
that was an amazing break down and thats why peter is my favorite hero too because he struggles to do whats right for very relatable reasons and as an adult i feel that i feel the temptations i feel the guilt trips and the unappreciation and the desire to just worry about myself or to not trust anyone to to live life alone because differences in opinion or you feel something is unfair or your pride is hurt peter had so many reasons to just look out for himself and sometimes we only stop when we are given a good enough reason to uncle bens death or w e the case may be when i was in highschool i thought everything could be fixed with hardwork prided myself on that trait i had when i succeeded in school and start experience success but now as an adult like peter shows it s deeper then that and unlike this cultures loves to teach us it s not the only reason that life is hard for people,0
i needed to go to bed but this video was so good i accidentally watched the whole thing great review man perfectly sums up what s great about these movies and even revealed some things i hadn t realized i need to go back and watch again from the peter is the villain perspective keep up the great work,0
being thrown at the bridge makes no sense ock throws him in front of himself then spidey emerges behind him,0
this is the best video on you tube i never watched ur videos before this was the first video and u made me emotional motivated and so many things i cant express,0
not only does he see peter as exceptional and harry as not but he sees peter as having earned or having had to fight for everything he has like himself while harry was given it,0
who d u give this poll to,0
i don t understand why that mask doesn t have a moving jaw plate to still keep stunt double s hidden while moving their mouth,0
okay but that ad was hilarious give mark your money give me your money lmao absolute gold fellas makes me thirsty for some gfuel,0
mark is such a phenomenal writer speaker his tones inflections pacing delivery and structure honestly it s all incredible i m not sure how you re able to write in a way that helps you remember the perfect inflection delivery of every line especially when your scripts get as long as this it s almost superhuman in itself when he speaks he not only reminds me of the stories i ve seen and or love but he paints them in my head again nearly as vividly as when i first watched them sometimes to such a remarkable degree that it causes me to tear up it s borderline magical how he s able to pull emotions out of me when even the source material in real time may not have done so he s so gifted talented he s truly found his calling it clearly doesn t have to be anime mark can talk about anything and as long as he cares about it or cares enough to put in the effort to ensure others have a good experience watching it it ll be great it happened many times with one piece naruto but it only really just hit me in this video i could watch listen to mark review anything in depth definitely gotta keep editor san ajay on the payroll though they re doin god s work lol i m not sure what direction he ll go after the toei difficulties but now it s clear the story doesn t matter as long as mark is putting his heart into it it ll be outstanding and quite possibly cause my eyes to overhydrate themselves can t wait to see what he does next,1
im glad that everything turned out alright making the newest spiderman movie and not like in the first one with tobey maguire where somebody died while making the festival set and then all the dollar spiderman costumes where stolen from their storage place which caused the movie much longer to be released from it s original release date,1
just have to say this how the shart does mj get to the final battle in every movie,0
yeah sure eddie has a good reason to hate peter spider man he only tried to ruin spider man s image by attempting to frame him for a crime because spider man broke his camera yeah sure sandman has good reason to hate peter spider man he only killed peter s uncle while trying to commit an armed robbery and as seems usual for him tries to excuse his criminal behavior due to his circumstances yeah sure harry has a good reason to hate peter spider man he surely knows by this time that his father was the villainous green goblin who committed multiple public assaults and murders nearly killed harry himself at the fair kidnapped and nearly killed m j so his obviously and completely undeniably evil father got himself killed by spider man while endangering a bunch of school children and m j and he bloody well knows this no each of this people made there own beds eddie tried to frame spider man out of spite sandman killed a man during the commission of a armed robbery harry ignored the mountains of evidence yelling in his face that his father was a evil violent madman who needed to be stopped before he killed more people and ignored the history of spider man not killing anyone else to construct a warped fantasy wherein spider man was a murderer and his saintly father was the wronged victim,0
here s why i think doc ock is able to take spider man s punches spider man holds back the obvious one it s well established spider man holds back his punches in the comics he fought a fairly large man knocked him out cold with a flick of his finger a regular punch would likely kill someone spider man is losing re gaining his powers in the bank fight peter is losing his powers his webbing stops midway so his powers are weakening including his strength later in the burning building he couldn t barge down a door without hurting himself so not only is he holding back his attacks he s losing them simultaneously and during the train fight it can be argued his powers are still returning slowly when doc ock sabotages the train that s when they fully return as peter wills them to stop the train looking at it from that it not only helps explain why ock can take his punches but makes stopping the train more impactful this is where his powers return completely after losing them throughout the film they re finally back doc ock s arms numb his pain doc ock s arms have strong control over his mind influencing his id making him act on his dark emotions as such since they control at good deal of of his mental awareness it can be argued they control a portion of his nervous system which connects to the brain particularly his pain receptors numbing his pain or transferring it to themselves so when spider man attacks ock it might damage his body but he doesn t feel pain rather the arms do hence why they react more like they re taking the attacks than he is all these added up we get spider man holds back his attacks against doc ock whilst his powers are leaving him the arms help numb ock s pain and receive it themselves the criticism is there but this does weaken it a lot,0
you claim that the aunt may in the raimi movies presents sincerity but i contend she does not yes the actress does a great job but aunt may herself is hardly sincere she calls spider man horrible until he rescues her up until that point halfway through spider man she has little regard for spider man despite him having rescued dozens if not hundreds of people including people she knows m j but once he rescues her he becomes a hero in her eyes no i disagree aunt may is not really sincere in the raimi movies she has some self centeredness as she cannot see a hero as a hero until he saves her,0
you re points about how fantastic rosemary harris aunt may is reminds me of how much of a poor job the mcu has done with her character she s a shell of what she used to be,1
i m a big fan of james franco my friend please reconsider he a predator,0
why what i don t wh what why wh i wh why what wha w w i d h why who what,0
i swear to actual god if you put miles people would vote him he is way too overrated,0
great review love your stuff,0
tobey still is my favorite spider man and especially peter parker but andrew gardfield is my favorite actor out of all three which makes me super happy that both tobey and garfield got good endings as both were supposed to get a sequel to their final films,0
toby in spiderman is still in the box office,1
dude move your phone further away from the mike i can hear the interreference noise throughout the video,0
this video made me feel more emotion than the entire mcu combined,1
i ve always loved the nd movie that speech is the thing i replay the most because it gives me goosebumps amazing job to all the people it took to get this video made,1
for me it is always tobey maguire,1
i grew up with the raimi trilogy and i still dont think they are very good,1
tobey is my spider man,1
hi mark and i came to support why a spanish youtuber like me speaks in spanish he told us about your unfair case and i want to help you so continue i know that you strive to be the best of content,0
oh green goblin,0
thank you i really enjoyed it even more than the trilogy itself,0
this was really well done thanks for the effort and excellent content,0
,0
why tf goblin killed himself sounds dumb why ock not dead with punch same with norman and where did he get the suit and why not dead no way home why do villains show up out of nowhere to him,0
but mark that s not spider man that s the human spider,0
spider man was definitely the standard but overall the raimi films are highly romanticized and overrated the mj character and casting haven t been right since the animated series raimi combined mj and gwen stacey gwen was the girl next door and mj was a party girl there are always peripheral traits story arcs and aspects of characters overall that are adjusted depending on the medium but it s important to make sure that they don t change the fundamental nature of the character story and mj being the party girl who s down for anything to have a good is extremely important not so much for spider man but definitely for peter parker who sees in mj everything he d love to be and can t peripheral traits are much different than defining traits also mj is supposed to be smokin hott and kirsten dunst isn t even close to that giving her a rating on the hott o meter is being generous and grading on a curve instead of using topher grace as eddie brock also horrible casting raimi should ve used topher s s show cast mate to play mj laura prepon in the early s was perfect for the role what about eddie brock i always felt like seann william scott would ve been good in that role in fact he was my personal choice to play deadpool back in when i was and heard that fox was bringing the x men to the big screen i still think he would ve been incredible as wade wilson but that clusterf ck of a franchise and its casting are a completely different conversation,0
well narrated bravo,0
this is oh so terribly biased,1
disagree with how the suit mutes the performance removing the mask in the movies just to show the actors undermines the concept of secret identity,0
i love how raimi was not afraid to show the heros suit being torn and battered from a fight and how it would make the viewer feel like he was really giving his all for a fight,1
the amazing spider man movies don t deserve as much flack,0
i love your videos keep up the good work,0
the reason he changes positions and jobs every movie is that in the cancelled spider man he was revealed to be mysterio,1
this always bothered me about spider man otto says intelligence isn t a privilege it s a gift but then he says it s a privilege at the end when peter talks to him it s a little incongruence that i don t see anyone else mention and it took me out of the immersion a bit when i realized it as a kid in a wonderful film but i can t help not see that part as a bit of a mark side note spider man should have been a sandman story peter would struggle with negative emotions about learning the truth and his time with the black suit amplifies that by the end he sheds the symbiote and then harry who s been conflicted about his truth this whole time comes into contact with it in spider man harry would be venom,0
so to explain the otto octavius not immediately getting wrecked every time spider man touches him the inhibitor chip frying basically removed the limiters on the tentacles but by extension stopped protecting otto s higher brain functions among those functions include the unconsciousness response that would likely be initiated after taking a concussion by extension otto s own supernatural constitution is a result of this it s not that he s suddenly become stronger it s that his muscles and body as a whole are exerting themselves with no regard for long term health and wellbeing he s at all the time,0
they really should have swapped venom for the punisher as one of the villains in the third movie could have had constant tension where spider man constantly saves sandman and harry goblin from the punisher killing them venom was just fanservice in the third movie wasn t feeling it guess i just really enjoyed spider man taking on the punisher in the comics kinda disappointed that they never brought it on film same with kraven and the chameleon kraven s last hunt would make for a perfect netflix series,0
this video is a perfect example of what youtube should be about my nigga mark killed it again,0
this man sounds like vitruvian physique,0
just watch the newest one and it blows the rest out of the water,0
i just love spiderman,0
damn you make some good observations not much heroism in superhero movies these days just lots of cynical film making,1
as expected your raimi review did not disappoint your videos are always so good i really hope you come back to finish this project happy holidays mark,1
that g fuel commercial though,0
only character i hate i these movies is mary jane because she is super manipulative and in soiderman she forgets everything she said in soiderman and just fucks shit up,0
before watching spartacus blood and sand i never realised just how much of sam raimi s work i ve watched since being a kid,0
let s face it bully maguire makes spidertobey looked good people just weren t ready for it in,0
well shit this made me tear up what the hell dude,0
sonic,1
personally i had no problem with not being able to see him talk as i can still hear him i definitely don t think it has lack of emotion or i d a flaw at all it s not important that we see his face while the mask is on and he definitely doesn t loose humanity emotion or character also i like spiderman too,1
tobey the goat,1
spider man is numero,0
epic,1
incredible video,1
had to pause this video minutes in when he started talking about his dad felt like he was talking about my mum unfortunately she didn t make it,1
these were the first majorly good super heroes films spiderman will always be my favourite from the comics to the anime to the film s,1
the others can burn far as i care tobey maguire will always be number spiderman tobey maguire is a god of the marvels,0
spoiler they do hold up and are actually the best spider man movies to date haven t seen no way home yet but i just know that ain t beating at least sm and,0
how to be a saiposexual and give head to a half million sexually deprived persons during a pandemic make video essays about spider man removes excess webbing,0
how did the algorithm wait weeks to show me this video blasphemous,1
the thing that no way home got terribly wrong about dock ock and green goblin is that it treats them as one dimensional it presumes that all the evil in dock ock comes from the mechanical arms and not within himself so when peter removes the arms control over him he turns completely good the same thing for green goblin when he is not taken over by the goblin he becomes a sweet and innocent norman osborne the movie does not acknowledge that the villainous desires lay wthin otto octavius and that he is the one making the choices not the mechanical arms the mechanical arms only make him delusional and insane the movie does not acknowledge that the goblin lays within norman osborne and that norman is actually a horrid and power hungry man not some evil spirit called the goblin so that s what really bugs me about this movie it s still pretty great though,1
oh,0
dont forget the meme of all memes besides im a bit of a scientist my self bit where s my rent,0
tobey looked and acted like a loser and a nerd that s who parker is garfield was trying to be too cool and was too successful so not believable decent spiderman though with the jokes but still a weiner tom holland had the youth getting old now and was brooklyn but didn t feel as loserish as tobey his spider is decent as well tobey was able to capture what i thought peter park should be and his spider man probably not the best but pretty close to the s spiderman cartoon that i m familiar with so that s why i go with tobey as the best still edit well this video was good at pointing out why these tobey films were good spiderman films except for was still meh,0
,0
,0
toby was the best peter parker and those movies were for the time the best comic book movies ever now tom s spiderman movies are basically the best super hero movies ever but tm is and will always be the goat,1
i m seeing this on the st for my th birthday with my bruddas one of my bros are seeing this today so he s gonna be down to watch it again when we go see it then i ve been watching raimi s spider man and back to back when i was years old i was born is and then my grandma took me to go see spider man when i was years old and i remember it till this day so spider man always has been and always will be my favorite mcu hero since as young as i could remember so the personal anticipation and hype that i have for this movie is immensely high,0
wow this is exactly how i feel i m so glad you said this i legit thought i was the only one going through something like that,0
my favorite spiderman is definitely andrew garfield even though i grew up with tobey maguire yes he definitely doesn t have the best movie s especially the second one and he might not be comic accurate in every sense but goddamnit he s a great actor and i love him,0
just watched no way home early cuz i work at a theatre i thought it was fantastic great fights amazing soundtrack just stellar in nearly every department gonna go into spoilers a little bit they kill off a major character halfway through and they bring in a couple new faces for one of those let s just say he s a really good lawyer the characters were written with love and respect to their own respective movies the only problems i have with this movie is how they dealt with sandman a little and the fact it s a marvel movie which means a lot of jokes when there shouldn t really be there i give it a solid imo i put it right next to endgame i thought that when endgame came out marvel peaked i was wrong years of spider man into movie and it is incredible also norman says the i m something of a scientist myself line and i love it,1
i m called crazy for enjoying spider man the most i get it but i was a comic kid the rd movie feels like a page special to me the writing style isn t to dissimilar and i guess it reminds me why i loved comics in the first place that s just my take i do omit that just because i like it does not necessarily mean that it s a good movie,0
i think the rami films did so well due to the scores and the direction the angles and way it wad filmed was so grounded in reality aside from him being spiderman,1
toby maguire is the best spiderman in my opinion absolutely love him as a actor and a spiderman he s a nostalgic spiderman and he s just really good at being spiderman and peter i love it,1
do you know how terrible it would look if there wasn t a mask,0
great analysis love these movies,0
mark these commercials you make aside from your amazing videos prove that you need to continue your journey you have what it takes to be an incredible filmmaker screenwriter director whatever you want to be stay strong and we ll see you in,0
no matter what toby will always the the best of all of them and andrew we re good and tom goalless was good but toby magurie movies were classics,0
i really enjoyed your personal story from my father had a stroke about a month ago he s only so it was out of nowhere and terrifying to think that could ve been it i know exactly how that feels and is very anxiety inducing glad to know im not the only one whose felt that way,0
this video hits so hard man awesome and emotional video,0
the comment about spider man not knocking out doc ock the number of opportunities he had is comic accurate spider man subconsciously pulls his punches for fear of seriously hurting someone,1
tobey is the best spider man he can climb like the other but tobey s spider man can shoot webs without gadgets,1
its covered in the comics a bit more in depth but peter always pulls his punches when fighting since he wants to incapacitate his opponent but avoid injuring them as much as possible hence he rarely ever does a one hit ko,0
bully maguire best peter,0
this is an amazing video,0
k likes and dislikes impressive,0
you really romanticized this review,0
mixing on this video is dog shit why the fuck is it that every time you show a movie clip on the screen that the audio is in one ear,0
for some reason this video made me wish that somebody made a clip of when doc ocs wife is screaming and it shows the reflection in her eyes of the glass shards flying at her but instead of glass shards it s peter parker walking towards her with boxes of pizza the power of pizza in the palm of my hand,0
the amazing spider man aunt may is a jerk and the mcu aunt may is just not aunt may it s good but it s not what aunt may is supposed to be at least in my eyes,0
this is the greatest video,1
ok i low key love how hard you re simping for aunt may lmao,0
i am so tired of spider man raimi trilogy getting so much praise it mediocore at best edit good vid tho,1
the movies are so good tobey is definitely the best imo,0
there is a reason my dad named me toby,0
spiderman was classic no question about it spiderman i hate it so bad with a passion spiderman the best my favorite spiderman film fight me if y all have problem with that,0
the way you talk about these movies made me choke up a couple times they were my favorite when i was a kid as well,0
the tobey maguire movies have high highers than tom holland but lower lows as well tom holland s films have been more consistent,0
u did a great job on this video gave me even more perspective in these movies for spider man himself tobey s spider man i felt was the best but now i m convinced,0
amazing video great job,0
compare this to mcu spidermans nickelodean acting omega,0
video man keep up the good work,0
man that middle part got me tearing up i m so sorry to hear about your family sicknesses and this is my first time here but i m guessing your in australia cause i know just how bad these lockdowns have been it s inspiring hearing you take some amazing movie advice and take it on in your own life and i completely agree keep pushing on through we definitely do all have a hero inside of us,0
idc what people say i love spiderman,0
i couldn t agree more this is the definitive aunt may one of the best character in spiderman,1
i cried watching him again on nwh i can t believe this can t you imagine i was just or yo when this movie came out no one can replace him i don t care he s not comic accurate at all he s still the best,0
bruh didnt even watch the best spiderman nicholas hammond,0
ive watched listen to this video times within the past days while at work well done tnm,0
homem aranha ficou at bonito vtnc impressionante,0
thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for giving rosemary harris the credit that she deserves,0
this is a great video so i m liking and commenting,0
you re too picky,0
your words and your breakdown of these films has given a whole new perspective great video,0
commenting thanks again for what had to be herculean effort to make happen you re the best parts of ega and eww at both greater lengths and comprehension you guys are badass,0
great job,0
that s what mr sunday movies does he comes in makes himself at home shows you an annoyance in a movie then leaves,0
no just shut up it s a fact raimi is king of comic movies you can just shut up and accept it seriously tom holland and his diverse blm compatible and lgb compatible friends is just sony being chicken and bending over for todays salty society the raimi movies didn t give a damn it told the story and a damn good one and didn t tip toe around politics and be self conscious if someone will be offended by something and at least unlike tom tobey didn t go on talk shows and spoil the next upcoming movie i wouldn t hire tom to be in a movie even if you paid me a million he s a jackal who kisses butt how else is he not blacklisted from hollywood yet,0
i can t believe i watched this video for almost hour but it was a good video,0
a little late but toby is the best,0
awesome video,0
blah blah blah tom holland and the new suits are so awesome and have a touch of ironman to them which makes it even better,0
i disagree with the whole mask thing a mask can t capture the feeling you were talking about without the eyes moving being animated even the artist you mentioned while he does show the mouth nose etc the only reason those paintings show raw emotion is because of the eyes which are drawn in a way that can t be captured by a mask that is not animated e g tom holland s after all that is how masks are supposed to work they cover your face you are not supposed to be expressive through one the reason the comics can do it is because you can alter the facial features such as the eyes,1
hats off to you what an amazing video watching this has really helped me fall in love with the raimi trilogy all over again and has given me some fresh perspective,1
about that part where you nitpick about how peter should be able to knock otto out funnily enough otto himself learned why when he took over peter s body in the superior spider man run he was attacked by scorpion and punched his jaw off in one punch snapped a superhuman s jaw off he learned that if he didn t hold back then he would kill every villain he touched maybe he can t find or isn t willing to give hundreds of crooks concussions to try and find the middle ground where he knocks people out,0
mark this was amazing i m sorry for your loss and i m so happy too hear your father is healing up i ve been a fan of your content for years now and has gotten me through some really rough days i just want to thank you for making such quality content and most of all for this spider man is my favorite character in any fictional medium and i m so glad you re a fan as well i know you don t know me from a hole in the wall but i just want too say here from texas i love you brother keep your head up hero,1
gonna cry,0
i was born in i was into comics before the cartoons well my father put me on,0
this is beautiful,0
loved the video yet i disagree with the emotionless mask as a bad choice as it fulfills the actual purpose of wearing it you see while norman wears an intimidating mask helmet akin to his personality and lust of power peter uses it to hide his emotions which is coherent to his more reserved nature,1
if you want that mask over face look there s always the nicholas hammond my first live action version and japanese spider man shows,1
you mention the only reason i don t like spider man he s a victim of bullying and he is a bully now this isn t fair of all his characterizations and i am a fan of all the live action movies from raimi onward but spiderman is not my favorite character,0
i remember that face from a bronx tale,0
i m glad you re giving rosemary harris the love she deserves her performance is incredible,1
the thing with the face shell is that while i do agree it becomes emotionless it s also to make sure the lenses don t bunch up or the mouth being visible because the usually have the lenses being flexible and seemingly part of the fabric while the movies have them be these thick weighted lenses that affect the fabric when they re sewn on for the shots of them taking off the mask,0
the g fuel ad is literally the best ad i watched everything from the start of it to the end had me actually hooked seeing my childhood favorite movies getting reviewed by a god tier reviewer was like hearing everything i wanna hear and also pointing out flaws i could consider i know a lot has been going on but i just wanna say keep up the great work mark you re a shining star,1
i had to watch this video twice as my eyes were filled with tears the first time and that part about grandma and father resonated with me as i went through same this year thank you,1
that advertisement was,0
i get you but the expression thing is just not going to work in rea live adaptation the eyes moving is enough there s no practical way to make the mouth visible it would defeat the purpose,0
spiderman is also the funniest of the when it wants to be,0
tobey carried movies tom was a supporting actor sorry to say,1
spiderman swinging take a look miles morales,0
the thing about the masks is spiderman canonically wears them to not only hide his identity but also make it so that the villains he face don t read into his emotions of weather he s scared or triumphant so even though the tobey or the garfield suits are expressionless it s almost like it s meant to be that way unfortunately the audience suffers from this chase of authenticity,1
no way home is about to hit the theaters i doubt it will be able to live up to spiderman,1
first spider man movie was broadway y kinda fun somewhat theatrical being about power second one was on a move being comfortable with it s supernaturality third one was that one that was somewhat somehow close by spirit and atmosphere to the next spider man series with andrew garfield which was more about being a highschool smart teenager that got superpowers than an adult that had to deal with having superpowers and balancing it with worl love life that rami spider man series were,0
i don t agree with the point about the faceshield beneath tobey s mask muting his emotions and performance i mean it did but you just have to look to the mandalorian to see how to get around that my main gripe with tobey and andrew s suits is that they looks too good how did these kids make these professional movie quality suits at least in the mcu peter made himself a janky looking suit and it was tony who made him the proper one,0
the soundtrack in this trilogy is simply amazing too,0
can t even give my opinion cause i m so blinded by nostalgia,0
making me cry at am about fuckin spiderman my guy,0
i came here to watch a movie review and you got me tearing up and shit wtf bro,0
i don t agree with the mask part there are many critical scenes where his mask is damaged and you can see his facial expressions,0
not gonna lie im sorry toei was shitty to you but i am glad it happened because i found this channel great video subscribed,0
bro that ad was fucking awesome im buying a fucking case today please tell me you have a promo code with your name on it,0
raimi trilogy feels like what spiderman should be,0
thank you,0
yeahhh tobey,0
this was extraordinary,0
fantastic review,0
when are you doing italian spider man,0
fantastic video mark,0
i love j jonas jamison,0
i was there to see them all when they released owned them also but they don t compare to tom hollands spiderman,0
from to an overwhelming amount of nostalgia went through my body,0
tobey is definitely the best andrew is second and tom is just for year olds,0
for whatever reason avi arad has this weird obsession with the character of venom he s the main one that pushed raimi into making spiderman include venom,0
i loved these films as a kid,0
i love raimi but i just can t stand toby as a person,0
lol i always wanted to explain wy i love spider man so much but never knew the real reason why but now i can,0
the problem that you have with peter being able to knock otto is actually explained by him as peter in superior spider man peter reduces a lot of his strength when hitting them to not cause damage to them,0
its worth watching all of it,0
my ranking homecoming far from home amazing spider man spider man spider man amazing spider man spider man,0
amazing reviw love it so mutch spider is my favorit hero too your job is amazing,0
nah man spider man is still garbage i was kind of hoping you would help me see it through a different light but your review of it made me remember how much i hate it i cannot stand how there s a random exhibition butler who is like oh i see you ve ruined your entire life tried to kill your friends and are physically scarred now i guess now is a good time to explain that it s all just a big misunderstanding and he says it so unemotionally and isn t a character but a plot device the laziest plot device i have ever seen in film that s just one thing that is inexcusable but there are plenty of others i never liked venom much when this came out saw him as a big dumb slobbering edgelord monster but this is the only movie where when the credits were rolling and i was walking out i felt compelled to actually flip off the screen not because anyone could see me do so not as a message to anyone as i tried to be discreet with it no i flipped off the film because i despised it to my very core,0
love this video i wish sony would make the games available on pc spiderman was such a big part of my childhood i won t buy a ps or to play it but love the video,0
i m tellin ya joe rogan that muddafucka doc ock came on the train and i tells em if you wanna get to him you re gonna have to go through me cocksucka,0
your nit pick on the punches not knocking out doc ock is fine however how ive always seen it that because the arms have control over him they re able to keep him conscious where otherwise he would ve been knocked out they have control of his conscious so they re able to resist the k o imo,0
in full honesty i really dislike these movies,0
honestly i agree with pretty much all of this and have for years the main thing i disagree with is the mask movement as i always saw these movies as a more realistic attempt for spider man in the sense of you don t need to tell his emotion through his mask he still makes jokes and you generally can tell that by body language and what he says at given moments the argument that he doesn t emote as much as comics wouldn t really fit in with the realism that was attempted the eye panels arent going to become huge or dim depending on mood etc and o felt it was justified to not and raimi did a great job expressing emotion through voice movement and music during scenes,0
a year ago decmber th lost my grandfather i knew it was coming that did not make it any easier the week before he was getting better recovering from a stroke that they were talking about a few weeks of rehab and then going home he was getting better until he suddenly wasn t family was the most important thing in the world to him and we couldn t give him a proper farewell until this past october it s nearly a year to the day and i feel like i still haven t been able to process it or accept it your personal reflections about spiderman connected with me because of that,0
the most frustrating part of spiderman for me is how mary jane treats peter parker in the first part of the film instead of peter struggling to live the life he wants like in earlier films it s mary who is frankly jealous of spiderman as she has her own struggle anything peter does wrong he puts onto spiderman not himself which she sees through but while that helps peter s character arc into a better person mary is left lambasting peter every time he tries to support her my point is mary hurts peter through her jealousy regardless of if she s justified or not and it s that pain that makes peter lash out against her as venom the problem is what did mary jane learn she realizes that she loves peter again but the problems she has in her life should still be there at the end of the day i think she was going through what peter did in the nd film but with no pay off it was an excuse for peter to be angry at her and eventually hit her physical violence is very bad but she crushed him emotionally on the day he wanted to propose to her to me it kind of makes them both in the wrong but only peter had an arc that let him correct his mistakes and rip venom from himself the best mary jane got was to stop kissing harry staying faithful to peter is not the same as improving her relationship with peter,0
mary jane in raimiverse is the most bitchy character i ve ever seen,0
just rewatched all of these movies i can safely say spider man is as bad if not worse then i remember it when i saw it in at the age of,0
listen i have to talk about how an ad just absolutely wrecked your poignant moment with sandman you were about to say the quote that defines sandman and then the ad immediately interrupts with saying am i pregnant,0
rewatching this for the purposes of this review shows shirtless ock,1
i didn t even know i was watching an ad and i fricking love it i need some g fuel and to take a steamy hot dump,0
love it awesome way to warm up on spider week,0
ayoooo sounds sus,0
maybe we can all just pretend that if the arms have control over oc s mind therefore they also have control over his pain receptors or keep him conscious longer they do know how to operate with him being unconscious in the autopsy scene so it s not that far of a stretch is it,1
this may be a hot take but mj is the weakest part of the raimi movies for me,0
mark i know you aren t going through the best of times right now but i just wanted to say that this might be one of if not the best video you have made i wasn t even the biggest fan of the raimi trilogy but this was amazing you haven t stopped getting better and finding your own voice it s great to how far you ve come best of luck,1
that has to be the best ad roll i ve ever seen,0
i love homecoming and i really wish they kept continuing peters character in the second movie but it felt very mcu sequel like,0
thank you for making this video,0
tobeyyyy,0
toei no u didnt make any spiderman movies,0
terrible movies its ok and are terrible i think that nostalgia got the best of people here if these where new movies would be shitted by everyone,0
the rd one i actually enjoyed a lot they were all gold and i hold them tightly and dearly i loved all of the villans and i think sandman and venom were really good villans even tho it might be rushed or not plan i thought it came out amazingly,1
well about spidey not knocking off doc oc with a single punch we could use the excuse of him literally pulling his punches not to knock doc s head off or that he can surpass his strength limits when protecting someone not quite when he s on the offensive which seems to be a thing in the comics too,0
i prefer tobey s suit over any other suits any day about the expression part well i never noticed them being flat instead i appreciate how director managed to make us feel what spidey feel cgi suit looks awful you can tell its cgi and fluctuating eyes look funny even in serious situation heck we cant even see black lines on cgi suit,0
you can t deny sam raimes got the spiderman suit right and toney played the derby college kid becoming a kool witty hero but still nerdy lol perfect,0
letsgo mark,0
i am glad that i found this on the right time,0
love this vid giving you all my love and support fuck toei,0
i loved this triology as a kid but after rewatching it i realised it is kinda a meme and not that good,0
someone once said toby s story was the darkest andrew was the funniest tom is the realistic one,0
ok this review was amazing and all but that g fuel ad block was ridiculously well made i don t think any other youtuber has sold me on it as well as mark has,0
william dafoe is truly perfect in this movie,0
i met the actress who played aunt may when i was around five or six i was so obsessed with those movies some of my first words were the spider man movies i couldn t work up enough courage to go up to her so i stood on the other side of the room and looked with my jaw on the floor,1
kirsten was a terrible casting choice as mj came across as insecure and quirky she was supposed to seem more confident sassy and outgoing as opposed to peter being an introverted insecure nerd drawing him out maguire at least had the nerd look and feel down though ofc we ll never forgive that dancing scene new spiderman suffers a bit too much from trying to be young and hip and relevant within the mcu though i like spiderman a little campy and old fashioned aunt may should be an old lady and spidey doesn t need sidekicks,0
i know disney and sony want to protect tom s looks in the fight scenes but if they ever asked raimi to direct no way home s fight scenes against goblin tom will get a brutal beatdown the final fight in the st movie had weight behind goblin s fists,0
i think the reason peter isn t knocking out doc oct with one punch is because he stills sees dr octavius and knows he s just a human he wants to cause as little harm as possible and maybe doesn t have the control to knock him out with one punch without causing serious injury,0
has anyone ever put more effort into an ad spot gfuel needs to promote you to an ad consultant rather than just an influencer,0
he is my favourite spider man aka tobey maguire,0
how could you support that spider menace don t you realize hes the villian j needs more pictures of spider man,1
dislike,0
best breakdown i ve ever seen,0
toby maguire getting all the votes cuz his spider man movies are memes,0
andrew garfield,0
this is the first totally not mark video i m watching but whoa that g fuel ad very professionally done,0
holy cow i already loved the ramai trilogy but this video made me love it even more i even tiered up multiple times showing this trilogy it s strengths and why this trilogy was very true spider man i m also happy people are talking about the trilogy again also your gfeul commercial made me think it was official you did a really good job and i m impressed about this whole video,1
not mark will you make a video on the amazing spider man like a full in depth review that talks about the good and bad aspects of tasm and tasm,0
but for the costume part i do prefer that the suit shows emotion and expression but i also like how they did it with andrew and tobey it feels more realistic that way imo,0
this is my opinion but i think the insomniac playstation version of spider man is the best and yes better than tobey maguire imo,0
it s kinda hard to compare anything to alex ross s art though ross is the best comic artist probably ever,0
sadly alex ross is a god tier artist hard to convey that lol,0
when it comes to otto not getting knocked out by peter s punches i like to imagine the tentacles ai were forcing him to remain conscious despite the blunt force trauma ock in comics ended up with extensive brain damage and other injuries over his rivalry with spider man,1
been saying this since i was a kid drawing spidey while the movie played in the background would have loved something like the surgery scene where doc is knocked out by spidey but the arms keep fighting on maybe have one of the arms try to wake him up hope to see that in no way home in some way even if its just a few seconds,0
i rewatched spider man last month and tears welled up in my eyes at certain points,0
fantastic breakdown my friend and i have been tossing around the idea od rewatching the raimi trilogy and this has solidified it for me keep rocking it brother,0
i m really happy you spoke about rosemary harris s performance i just rewatched the trilogy and she stood out to me over every other character her there s a hero in all of us speech is masterfully delivered and it s the best part of the entire trilogy,0
the part about the masks not suiting the story was pretty dumb,0
j jonah jameson was perfectly portrayed one of my favorite aspects of these movies,0
kudos to you bro subscribed,0
same spider man is my favourite super hero and tobey maguire my favorite of the live actions no flashy or god like powers just good ol friendly neighborhood spider man d,0
all that suffering in the end it s always worth it remember this mark when you re feeling bummed about the situation,0
i m truly sorry to hear about what you had gone through with your grandmother and then father i understand how mentally and emotionally exhausting that can be my father began reading me spider man comics when i was young around four or five years old seeing the heroic actions of spidey on those pages helped lay the groundwork for the person i would become it was the earliest point in my life that i can remember where i felt my moral compass developing even if i didn t know what it was yet there have been many many times where i ve felt so lost and defeated and spider man media is something that i can always fall back on during difficult times to remind me why i need to pick myself up and push forward or do the right thing even when it is hard it brings me genuine happiness when i hear others stories about how this character has helped them,1
rosemary harris is a goddamned queen she reminds me so much of my mother sorry for your loss mark and your troubles i wish your father and yourself all the best i lost my brother years ago next week he bought all the comics coming into house growing up he gave me my love for all things marvel nerdy and spider man i placed him as my uncle ben as a way of motivating me to use my creativity which he and i shared it was my responsibility to do so as he didn t have the chance to i ve recently given up on a dream of having a career in filmmaking opting to take a corporate job with the hopes of just making things in my own time i havent done anything since i started the job as i ve been so stressed and just want to chill in the evenings thanks your video gave me an umpf of motivation a masterful analysis a new subscriber here from mayo,0
i rewatched these movies with my friends who have never seen them before days ago and watching with them made me realize these movies are nowhere near as good as i believe they were especially spiderman up until that point i believe spiderman was the best spiderman movie but god damn watching that back was actually painful at times peter comes across as such a creep or a straight asshole so often some of the decisions characters make or even dialogue characters have are either robotic or just don t seem like something people would say do honestly made me rethink my whole stance on tobey being my favorite spiderman he just seemed so weird in these movies,0
i thought i hated these movies but two minutes are enough to rediscover how much i loved these movies as a kid thank you,1
,0
green goblin,0
taht was the best ad ive ever seen,0
hey mark i wish you had been able to watch the editors cut of sm it changes the film just enough to make it much better,0
awesome,0
i needed him as a kid and found that once again i needed him that shit brought me straight to tears,1
my favorite spiderman movie is sam raimi s first my favorite super hero moive is x,0
i m tha thuggernaut bitch,0
awesome video i really enjoyed it i ve always been a big fan of the trilogy even the rd one while i certainly would never say it s the best one or anything it might be my personal favorite because it s very realistic when it comes to showing the problems in peter s and mj s relationship not all sunshine and lollipops most of all i love what they chose to use as the final scene of the movie and ultimately the movie series so much is expressed in the pain filled looks they give each other without even saying a word they just hold each other and you know that they re going to have to just start over from the beginning,1
tom holland spider boy tobey maguire spider man,0
man made me cry and punched me with a jj funny scene right after,0
i hope harry and his dad are brought back in no way home since the rule of the movie is they were brought here at the brink of death for the villains,0
great now i have to watch it again d exeptional video mark as always thank you,0
isn t just the most important line in that film but in the whole trilogy the citizens do come to hate spidey by the time of spider man he still finds a way to put responsibility first and finds away to remove the symbiote though and he saves everyone regardless,0
pull lift strength is not punching strength and yes he pulls the punches very much so he has the comparable strength a spider does for it s size multiplied by the difference in size between a human and spider,0
by comparison the new films feel somewhat soulless,0
fucking amazing,0
mark idk if you peruse these comments all that often but if you don t i hope someone in your circle can point this out to you i just reached the point in this video you described passing of your grandmother and the anxiety you had been struck with after your father s illness i m someone who has lived with similar anxiety most of my life even when i was little i constantly thought of my own mortality when you said you tried everything and then you saw spiderman all i could think about was how i found similar strength when i was younger in the adventures of goku vegeta and gohan and now as an adult thanks to your amazing and wonderful channel i have rediscovered the strength great shonen anime and manga provide through one piece hunter x hunter and especially though you haven t covered it haikyu i know you your team and the channel are going through a very turbulent time with the copyright issues and i just wanted to say thank you thank you for producing amazing content thank you for introducing me to one piece thank you for helping me rediscover my love of dragon ball thank you for convincing me to read naruto and most importantly thank you for being totally not mark love you guys that includes everyone who s ever worked on a video,0
bro why you cutting so many onions man,0
outstanding video mark it s a nice nostalgia trip watching video essay s on the raimi trilogy but you caught me off guard with the audio clips from the movie being in the right channel rather than both i only keep one headphone on at all times thought my headset was busted lmao,0
a good essay but would be nice to see video essay that doesn t mention covid i m sorry about your losses and this was very well made,0
algorithm comment,0
great video and break down helping me even find things to like in,0
for the algorithmus,0
the only thing good about the remi trilogy is the cinematography,0
can you review the first episode of the naruto,0
this really opened my eyes and helped me appreciate these movies more my only gripe is that you didn t mention how amazing the soundtracks were for these movies especially the rd movies soundtrack sandman s sad music made me get choked up when i was younger and now that i have a child it ll bring me to tears that s something that s missing from these newer spiderman movies,1
hold on just a second longer,0
hi totally not mark i heard about what s been happening with you lately,0
this video is soo good i can relate to everything you have said the way you explain everything to make you think about life in a different way thanks to this film is amazing spiderman has been my life from my first favourite childhood hero to now as a year old with kids of my own who have the same love for spiderman is just amazing,0
i think andrew was the best spider man just not a good peter parker,0
when he turns from sand to normal human it s all cgi even when he s human yep you heard that right there was no change to live action,0
in response to the whole he should be knocking out doc ock with every punch thing this was actually brought up in the comics doc ock had switched their minds bodies and he was trying to be a more efficient spidey and if i remember correctly doc ock as spider man tears off or breaks scorpions jaw leading him to the conclusion that peter parker and his mantra of great power comes great responsibility knew just how deadly he can be and thus trained himself to just exert and control his strength at that much of a level still he really should have trained it so that he one hit ko s dudes tho,0
being a person of a certain age i normally choose the actors i grew up with which would be toby but tom is a better actor performer in and out of the suit by a large margin this is of course completely aside of what my opinions may be about their respective films i m actually shocked about my preference and even rewatched the films to be sure yeah tom is my personal favorite by quite a bit and i think that knowing his background in dance and how much of his own stunts he does solidifies it for me they did a great job casting him,1
spiderman is the best tobey movie,1
the suit itself also hurts the fact tht peter is a struggling college student no way can a teenager make a suit so good when he s poor,0
what ur saying about the mask would be extremely difficult to achieve and you can kinda assume his facial expressions due to the dialogue and tone peter has that s my opinion if u don t feel that way that s ok too but personally i don t have any criticism with the suit,0
i think this one was my favorite thank you,0
interesting insight on the films good watch,0
here to support,0
i came to your channel because the insert shitty company here situation i followed because i wanted to support your fight but hell i stayed for videos like this the perfect combination of entertaiment and personal the comments marvelous the editing perfection the add in the middle masterclass so i thank company that should be proud of your work about them to bring me here and i m not leaving,0
to me these movies were great i really loved them but hearing and talking reviewing them like this i got a whole new respect for these movies thank you and they are some of the most amazing super hero movies,1
the people backing spider man by throwing junk at goblin was easily my favorite part also the third movie was a dumpster fire i watched recently and it was painful,0
after recently watching all spiderman movies i gotta say i love your take on i have not watched most of them in years so when i rewatched i was left thinking that it was really good and people over hate it honestly might be my favorite of the raimi trilogy,1
personally i think the first spiderman movie is super overrated and with relation to the actor i think tom holland fits a lot better but there is no denying that spiderman is the best film overall for the character outside of into the spiderverse that is that animated film is the best superhero movie ever made imo except for the dark knight,0
if you read the comics when doc oc is in peters body he actually says this peter pulls all his punches all the time spiderman on a scale is one of the strongest marvel heroes out there he could easily splat doc oc but why its against everything he believes in,0
the butler speech at the end of when he finally tells harry that norman killed himself and it wasn t peter s fault at all still ruins for me he couldn t have told harry that at the end of the first movie harry spends solid movies hating his best friend for no reason and the butler could have prevented all of that it s shitty shitty writing,0
black spider man was the best idk why maybe because i like spider man and i liked venom,0
sandman sucks period end of story,0
i still want a logan style spiderman movie,0
bully maguire bullies villains,0
me wait spiderman is actually good totally not mark always has been,0
spiderman rise of bully maguire,0
supported,0
spider man is hokey trash spider man is slightly less hokey trash spider man is overstuffed hokey trash the amazing spider man is flawed but fine the amazing spider man has some scenes that are good out of context but as a whole shit spider man homecoming is great spider man far from home is dumb trash spider man into the spider verse is the best superhero film of its decade,0
proud member of the andrews,0
now do a review on homecoming and far from home those movies are terrible,1
can t wait for andrew s review,0
thats what the point of the mask is,0
why am i crying,0
dude am eating wtf lmao,1
we will probably never have another fight like the one at the beginning of spider man since tom has artificial webs i seriously think organic webs are overhated but that might be because i grew up with them,0
i don t think it s a bad movie like everyone says it is but it s definitely not a good sam raimi movie even raimi himself isn t proud of it,0
the breakdown about the suit was f king fantastic never thought of it that way but it s always been right in our faces,0
i dislike the spider man costume because it has a mask on it and when there s a mask i can t tell how the character is reacting or any defining features of the actor underneath lol that is a hot take you re not supposed to be able to tell who is behind the mask or how they re feeling that s the point of wearing a mask lol,0
i love spider man and everyone that disagreed have a problem with me,0
this is the new benchmark for all ads,0
always thought that the arms were keeping doc oc awake active havent seen it in a while but i think he doesn t sleep either,0
fun fact those two little boys in the train was actually tobey real life half brothers,0
spider man is super underrated,0
i love your outlook on these movies i have always had this spiderman as my favorite and you summed it up,0
i agree with venom i disagree with venom plus sandman plus green goblin it should have been only venom i watched the animated series version of that story multiple times and could stand alone and should have,0
sorry doesn t pay the rent i have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent,0
i hate the narrative that peter is responsible for his uncle s death it takes all the responsibility out of the robbers hands peter could have stopped the robber and his uncle could have been hit by a bus at the time he should have been murdered he s not god and what happened happened and there is no way he would know what his action or inaction could lead to,1
toby maguire has the advantage of nostalgia and the fact we were mostly kids when we watched these so his movies definitely hold a special place in my heart and they just have a feeling to them that the new ones simply can t replicate,1
i watched this whole thing,0
i totally enjoyed this you should totally cover the other two but i d really love to hear your views on the dark knight trilogy or the batman movies in general seeing that next year is the year of the bat,1
yup i found the right channel for sure i can see why you are so crushed by everything going on you and your team definitely put alot of thought effort and ultimately work into your videos honestly truly a great interpretation of the films i even cried on the heartfelt parts you explained of each movie well done growing up i looked to movies in general as an escape from my life s harsh reality and i loved the feeling of getting caught up in films and imagining them as real life when i could completely get lost in a movie in the sense of loving every aspect to the point that i m not even thinking of it as a movie anymore but an alternate reality that i just visited that s when i feel a movie has done its job and these spider man movies growing up did that for me tobey maguire i feel personally will always be thee best version of spider man i could be biased cause its what i grew up with but i truly got to relive those feels as i watched your review on these movies and discover new feels that these movies now give me as a more understanding adult of deeper meanings again well done and stay blessed aloha,1
amazing job and analysis of these movies i m glad you agree that the rd movie isn t as bad as we all remembered when we were young hopefully we see our tobey in the new movie,0
expectations so high just like now with no way home,0
yeah i knew spider man from the s animated show too d,0
just want to point out when you mentioned peter s the villain the the third film it made ne realize that eddie brock venom at the end is a mirror image of if peter kept the suit,1
ahahah the nitpick with peter s strength doesn t hold up cu doc ok is way note durable than one would asusme he s literally an evolv d human he night as well be spider man with robotics and welding,1
there is no better feeling than finishing something i cannot wait to finish my life the way i aim to,1
that s it mark you can overcome toei just drink your gfuel and you can do it,1
miles morales,0
this was well documented very moving,0
hey mark why were your last videos privated,0
why does the videos of mark got privated,1
praise god god bless you all,0
am i the only person that actually likes spider man both now and when it came out,0
thank you for reminding me of my childhood and how i related to these films they too gave me strength when my sister and i were growing up through our parents divorce the inspirational quotes him home to me too,1
godspeed spider man dodges oh,0
i disagree about the mask i think stan lee said something like batman wears a mask to instill fear in his enemies spider man wears a mask to hide his fear damn beautiful but yeah i think hiding is expression is actually important,0
it is so amazing all of these actors are back three generations of spider man,0
i wonder how many people noticed that phill lamar i e greenlantern static shock kotal kahn was front and center on that train,0
i m a big fan of james franco uhh what i like some of his work but james franco is a pos fr,0
this is exactly putting into words how i feel about the ending of she ra and the so called redemption of catra hordak especially like yes it s a kids show and i don t hold to the same standards as stuff like arcane which i hope sincerely doesn t make the same mistake but whenever i bring up the fact that catra and hordak got off too easy at the end the fandom would get mad at me and ratio me constantly throwing attacks and insults telling me shit like incarceration doesn t make you a better person even tho i never implied that or believed that they put it in their minds that this was the right way to end the show and it ended perfectly just because they liked the rest i had it my head far before the finale aired on netflix that catra should aid n assist in the saving of etheira and the rest of the know universe to stop horde prime but instead of just getting a pass into the best friend squad she d just take the displaced horde soldiers who were also mostly orphaned children who were completely forgotten about by the end of series and head over to the crimson waste full of people running from their past as stated in the show she would ve had a change of heart and changed but the amount of shit that s she pulled through the course of seasons isn t just easily forgivable not to mention while she was in the crimson waste she took over an entire gang and just left she could ve gone back instead of abandoning them and the kids in the horde the same way she had been abandoned all her life not to mention how happy she was and how she was feeling herself in season if she went back there there s a chance that the rest of the folks she d take with her could get rehabilitation of some sort and or she could make her own place to live in which her skills are recognized etc there are a a lot of scenarios that could be implemented to improve the final season and the shows conclusions but i think that statement the having a change of heart and changing your ways doesn t mean all you ve done will be forgiven and forgotten especially when it s so much that it s near unforgivable is a wrap of one of fictions biggest problems especially when they re too focused on shipping,0
mark vernon is from space it s okay that he came down on a space rock,0
spider man peter s ego spider man peter s super ego spider man peter s i d,0
i hate the rami movies because there is no exaggerated swagger,0
to me the only good spiderman movie is spiderman into the spider verse,0
ok i was coming into this with low hopes but wow i m amazed at how well you understand this character reason being ot because idislike your content look forward to it every week actually but because a lot of people use sam s take on the character like its the default one when in reality it s very different from the original stan lee run abd i m so excited soemone understands this,0
spiderman was my childhood and this video is so nostalgic,0
man i watched this all the way through and was engaged the entire time amazing video,0
spiderman was complete ass i m sorry,0
this review got me bare emotional,0
he did when he fought goblin and got real mad we saw how strong he actually is while not holding back also humans do amazing feat when in dire state if a teenager can lift a car to save her dad look it up on internet then who can say peter with spider man power can t do same in dire state,0
everyone like tobey more you mean all the old people that follow you like tobey more,0
dont have to over analysis everything man just enjoy the movies,0
i like you gotta be honest tho i don t care ab the mouth movement as much tobeys wit and dialogue was miles ahead of anything we have gotten since,1
i m definitely more hyped for the new spiderverse movie but this this is going to be gold,0
this vid almost makes you forget that this is a anime channel,0
hc ffh spiderverse as as,0
what a fantastic review,0
i don t get why you would hate spider man like other bad sequels for example the fourth indiana jones or star wars episode this movie has some awesome elements it s my guilty pleasure and in the top of my favorite movies ever,0
daaaaaaaaaooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuug,0
daouuwgasikwlaiwnzmalaknw,0
fracking heack dawg,0
i m gonna marathon totally not mark videos until the toei situation is settled,1
i used to watch your videos a lot but kinda fell off saw the drama about toei and came back to this review and i remember why i used to watch you man you re so good at reviewing,1
we need supaidaman to appear on no way home as well,0
my fav is andrew,1
good luck with your ongoing situation with toei wish you the best,0
what they should have done in spider man is when the symbiote goes to eddie brock he should have just been teased as venom for spider man,0
modiji cameo in totally not mark s video,0
i like the new perspective on the third movie since rather than talking about what it was on the surface level it was about what the movie tried to be on a deeper one,1
may your grandmother rest in heaven and rest in peace sorry for your loss rih rip llyg,0
i prefer andrew garfield s spiderman while other two is good and all andrew s spiderman was the best,1
amazing video very insightful and you can clearly tell as a viewer the passion behind it i wish youtube had more videos of people talking about what they are passionate about rather then whatever is popular,1
elijah mikealson even in spiderman,0
very good review i also prefer toby s spiderman,0
mark spidey was better than i remember me we will agree to disagree,0
this video was amazing and made me realize things about spider man that i never did before,0
haha i never realized joey diaz was on the train,1
yo that gfuel commercial got me hyped,0
in november my grandfather passed from a serious heart attack the following year in may my grandmother has died from depression and an unknown disease so i know how it feels to lose someone and the raimi spiderman really taught me a lot,1
pat yourself on the back for making this beautiful video can t for no way home soon god bless,0
where part,0
my favorite and best spider man suit is the one tobey maguire has,0
great video,0
after having watched venom seeing venom in spider man doesn t feel right at all the spider man venom version is so very different that it s like two different characters,0
one thing i do somewhat disagree with is the cg in the rd film at times it wasn t too bad but at most i was cringing at how awful it held up,0
i m a bit older than you mark i remember back in the late s when stan lee would write articles talking about how they were going to wait to start making serious movies in the s when cgi was better and cheaper he not only wrote one article but i remember many i ve been so happy for stan the last years he did it,0
lol give mark your money give me your money,0
truly a fantastic video my god,0
goblin is the dark shadow of spiderman whereas doc ock is the dark shadow of peter parker,0
this is such a wonderful goddamn video in respect of recent events that have effected your channel some of the things spoken here mere days before the toei storm hit feel extremely appropriate to stay strong and keep your head up to persevere stay strong we re with you,1
fekin amazing,0
so many ads,0
this was a masterpiece one person can make a difference enough said,0
great video,0
the issue with peter s strength with lifting pulling and pushing things is the argument most people make with power scaling in something like dragonball lifting strength does not equal punching strength putting all of your strength into a punch is different than putting your whole body into a lift or push,0
i honestly didn t think i would like this video as much since it wasn t about naruto or berserk but i think mark can just pull anything off and make good transformative content out of it a true treat,0
actually they did try and tackle that problem in many emotional scenes spider man s mask is broken revealing his eyes and mouth for his reactions i find it very cool how when he gets battle damaged it really hits every emotional part that it should,1
fck toei,0
let s assume you suddenly got super strength how hard would you need to punch someone to knock them out but not cripple or kill them if young son goku would not live in a gag manga he would have killed most of his opponents,0
i guess i would not like to see the emotion of spider man as a child or as an adult because i believe his humanity lies within the character he becomes while the suit is on situation changes when peter is wearing the suit and it s perfect for me to not see himself sometimes doubting if he could fight or not and give the antagonist upper hand,0
my last comment on here as i have made many this video is perfect and aptly encapsulates what these movies mean and how they make me feel everyone should share this video because this is why spider man means so much to so many myself included spider man has been and always will be my favorite superhero of all time these movies were my childhood and i still love them to this day thanks totally not mark for this beautiful video and i hope you continue doing well in your journey this has been an experience,0
you should have waited for no way home,1
thanks for the awesome video i appreciate all the time and effort job well done i feel like your conclusion or main take away can be applied to the iron giant lol,0
spider man gets more flack than necessary because i think of it as the precursor to what the mcu would eventually become a superhero movie with serious moments but with some comical aspects thrown in,0
the thing about how otto takes spidey s punches even though being a mere human may be explained by the fact that the arms most likely help him roll with the punches or ensure that they are glancing blows at least also who knows how his physical makeup was altered after the accident i am sure someone could explain it could be crazy strength and adrenaline because in the comics otto does suffer down the line from all of those years of beatings,0
bravo bravo bravo nuf said,0
my personal fav spiderman is tobey but i think andrew had the best peter parker some of the scenes of him just being a teen really got me shame the films sucked balls the elements were there but it felt like a jigsaw puzzle had been forced together wrongly rather than actually completing it also andrew had the best costume thoughts,0
interesting point about the mask you re totally right come to think of it spidey was pretty good thanks for giving it the praise it deserved still love tobey and my love for spiderman the hero has just grown with every film i ve watched,1
i heavily agree that rosemary harris as aunt may is single handedly one of the most gripping performances in this series i wonder how she would have reacted to finding out peter is spider man,1
learn to edit your video first bro,1
the ps game implies otto always had that side of him too and that the inhibitor and arms are not wholly in control of him,0
tobey save mj every movie same way shes a crutch and he should find a stronger more capable woman kevin samuels would not be pleased with spidey simp garfield best holland is the super kid spidey aloof and everything is exciting kinda annoying if youre mature lol,0
damn way to make a dude cry lol the parts about aunt may hit hard spider man has a special place in my heart which is why i m so excited for no way home even if it doesn t live up to the rumors or hype,0
spider man is critically underrated,0
now i gotta watch all again tho i dont think i watched at all to this day,0
i actually teared up half way through,0
you did an amazing job man a perfectly detailed video like this needed to be made for these amazing films that i also grew up with and i m glad you did it,0
saw spiderman when you were lol you are literally the same age i am,0
i completely agree and relate to your thoughts on the aunt may speech even going beyond superhero films it s one of the greatest speeches i ve ever seen on film,1
spider man is just awesome and the whole sequence of peter loosing his powers because of stress in his life if so impactful i referenced it in my psychology exam paper and got a oh and spider man is my fav idk why but i just love it i have the best childhood memories watching that movie i love the idea of a hero becoming a monster then realizing he was wrong,0
after these hype i realised i am spider man fan,0
tobey,1
great reviews that gave me another perspective on how to view these films never thought of spider man as being an origin story for both peter and norman also my right ear enjoyed those scene moments not,1
spider man sucks,0
tobey has the best memes,1
that ad is a pure work of art,0
new sub here great video i look forward to future content,0
garfield s spiderman was terrible the possibility of him being in the new movie actually makes me feel better because maybe it means that it s an alternate universe where peter parker is a bad natured dickhead,1
i don t see any reason why people gave so much hate to andrew,0
hi mark just lemme tell you something i was never so happy for a recommended video before out of all spider man video essays yours is the one that really resonated with me once in a while i would see some of your dbs videos or recently berserk my favorite manga but seeing you review about spidey really hit me hard and i couldn t help but come here and say some words also subscribe to your channel a thing i hardly do since i don t spent as much time on the internet as before to start i am here with tears in my eyes and i want to say i feel sorry for your loss and what you ve been though these past years i too have been through a lot my best friend and surrogate brother passed away two years ago and recently may this year my dear granny which was more like my mom since she raised me with my aunt since i was a kid i was lucky for seeing her one last time at the burial but couldn t stay with her at hospital due what s happening right now in this world even tho it was pneumonia it always left me the feeling of lack of resolve since when i was born i was also very ill and for years she stood by my side holding my hands in the hospital and i couldn t do the same i tried so hard and just like you i had really hard time with anxiety and all that comes together for all the hardships we went through our lives until them although i am trying my best now but the reason i am saying this is i really hope you are ok and i am very thankful for such honest take and video i love these spider man movies and recently have been rewatching over and over due to their eternal message of conflict and hardship how one should do its best despite all odds which frankly is why the sam raimi trilogy always felt special to me since i was a teen back then i thought i knew what was hard until very recently i am facing my losses the mistakes of the past being and adult and not having a job for so long and feeling like the whole world is against me rising up again still like many other things in this life memories people videos like these we find a glimpse of positivity words that makes worth to fight for this is why i find it hard to connect to new spidey movies and comic books and i don t say that to be mean and shit on their fans and strenghts it s just because the raimi trilogy resonated better with me back then and much more now that life can sometimes look so tough i look on my old pile of spidey comic books and they helped me so much back then and their messages were so good like the boy that collects spider man or more recently leah among others that makes us feel immersed and different more than an action flick or full cgi fun it was just different and about your video i think you nailed it i can see how much effort and passion you put in these videos you make but also the honesty behind your works i can only be thankful today i think i needed some of your words sorry for oversharing here and also the long essay i am not as good as you speaking up my mind besides english is not even my native language but again i really appreciate this video and i just wanted to say your words really touched me and how i really feel by rewatching those pieces have a great day,1
amazing review i completely agree and relate with each of your points,0
bruh if seen spiderman mouth when talks i would be pissed honestly it would definitely stand out and ruin it,0
the nd raimi film is the best superhero film ever made the end,0
what a great video to think i just find this channel becouse of copyright claim,0
this was one of the greatest video ive ever watched on youtube thank you very much,0
i disagree with the random plot convenience point to an extent because the rock is the origin and the amnesia had a purpose to show us the good in this character,0
the reimi trilogy convinced child me that doc oc was actually spider man s arch enemy it took me years to realize that it was green goblin,0
such an amazing analysis finally i understood why people hate spider man even tho people like me loved it even when it came out st cuz i didn t know about venom or even spiderman before these movies i remember my comments when i st saw it i said it was the best spiderman movie people were expecting to see a cool venom like they saw in the comics or the animated series and they didnt thus hated it i think the casting for eddie is one of the reasons he wasn t really suited for the role,0
your opinion about the mask is pointless what s the point of a mask of it can t hide emotions your opinion is pretty stupid everything else is right,1
do reviews on cinemas other than anime so toei can t do anything,1
there is a way around the whole if spider man punched doc oc then he would be knocked out the way to look at it is if the arms are planted which i believe they are then they could be used to absorbe the impact of spider mans punches like a boxer moving away from an punch to lessen the blow that s my logic anyways haha,0
not a spiderman fan and i wouldn t normally click on this but gotta get that monies back for you time to learn sth about spidie,0
tobey maguire just hits different in spiderman movies back then,0
bruh nice,0
ppl are too stupid today,0
mark i know you watched the extended version of sm right though some of the added scenes are useless it s the change in some scenes order that really spice it up like peter s dance scene through new york is after he throws the bomb at harry that s him celebrating nearly killing his friend if you haven t give it a watch and come back to this topic sometime and see if any changes in opinions are there,0
glad to see the love spider man deserves underrated film,1
comment,0
spider man is the definitive origin story,0
in my mom died i couldn t save her that day something died inside me now am looking after my old dad but that movie gives you strength when you realise how aunt may spoke to peter,0
spider man is the greatest and most uplifting superhero film of all time brings me to tears,0
i agree yet i m tired,0
bruh it is sussy,0
fun fact during the thanksgiving lunch seen we can see peter wears green shirt while norman wears blue shirt and red tie this shows the opposite sides of both characters even more,1
i love that people have a different perspective and opinions on these movies because i ve always seen these movies as campy corni and ironically funny this video didn t change my mind on how i view this movie but i now i understand why people love these movies so much but it s kinda funny how you don t point out flaws of these movies,0
rewatching for the third time probably move on to your remaining videos next what happened is bs and you deserve the support,0
can t do dragon ball so you go to mcu understandable considering the issue,0
damn what a great video your analysis skills are outstanding considering i only just found you out just an hour ago with your particular delima but all in all you are a great content creator you are so good you helped me realize some of the problems that i have been having since the start of my senior year i was in a sense kicked out of my home of an abusive relationship a mentally scaring household and a lot of mistakes that i made with myself but while i was able to find a home because of a great friend of mine we ll call him j and i was able to live in his house with his family for a month a half while i was at that house i also had many thing happen as well such as me still being in contact with my mother and her helping out j s family i had gotten into my first romantic relationship and for me still to this day finding out who i truly am i had far more great memories than bad when i was living with j but what really hurt was towards the end of me living at his house mainly because of me and my girlfriend at the time what had happened was that we both rushed into our relationship way too fast than it should have been both of our mental states while dating and ultimately me being school years older than her i know it seems a bit bad but what we both felt at the time was actual sincerity acceptance for one another before my last two days in living in j s house i had been sad and the reason i felt like this was because i now had a clear picture of who i wanted in my life now that i wasn t shackled to my old household and who i wanted was my sister s family i say sister s because even though i grew up with this family for twelve years we weren t related therefore only being people i know but i find that to be bs and if anyone else thinks otherwise they can say whatever they want anyways after not being with or creating memories with this family for six years i finally got in contact with them and and found out they all never forgot about me it was then on that weekend my father or sister s father and i bonded and i asked if i could live with him and he said yes i got my stuff from my j s house thanked him and his family for my stay and got to my dads house and that s when things happend the next day around in the after noon i got a message from j giving me threats and ultimately losing a friend that day and after that my sister called her dad or our dad and she told him of things i m not to proud to say as an attempt for him to kick me out of that household around this time is when i started to create anxiety and some form of depression where my past started to come and haunt me not only from my mom s scum of a boyfriend but from the fear of whats to come from these people to top it all off a few weeks later my girlfriend tells we should break up because of her issues and because of her not being ready for what was going on between us not an exact quote but somewhat there and ended up breaking up only causing more stress and anxiety to myself i know seems stupid a senior who is is getting anxiety and depression from a break up but what can i say it was with someone who i truly care about and was ultimately hurt from the outcome of it after these events which i am in the third week of november am going through an emotional downward spiral and being upset with my regrets of my past which kind of brings us to today i feel much more better these days but still hurt from everything that has happened even though all these events started around the beginning of august but like i said i m in the stage of trying to move forward the reason i brought all this up is because of your analysis of these three movies and the one scene with aunt may at your dialogue literally had me with tears so if you can do that you are damn well good at what you are doing all i m looking for right now are answers for myself because i am lost in what i should do with my family my friends and with what i should be doing with my life all i really want is to be truly be happy again and want to be happy for those all around me but it just seems to damn hard at times i really hope i can get through this event in my life and that i can get support from those who truly do care for me but i want to say thank you for creating this video because these stories are ones that i grew up as well with and you truly put a smile on my face during these times for me the only thing that i have left to say is again thank you for your hard work that you provide not just to me but to the whole community as well and that i hope everything good comes your way because i truly want justice to come your way about this whole drama you are having with toei because you damn well don t deserve whats happened to you,1
on the other hand this stiff mask makes it more universal because everyone could be behind that mask and that is what spiderman is about,1
andrew is my fav spiderman because thats the first spiderman movie i ever watched then i watched tobeys movies and now i love both of them i am that s why,0
doctor connors was the best villain in all of the live action movies,0
god spiderman is still so damn good,1
i always loved spider man despite its flaws i could never quite explain why but it was so heartfelt and bittersweet it was a part of my childhood,1
i totally forgot joey diaz was in spider man absolute legend,0
good great good great fuckoff great great,1
i really like the point about the entire city being generalized as a side character never really thought about the spiderman movies like that,0
seeing the mouth move while wearing the mask is weird tbh but to each it s own,0
these movies have so many fantastic quotes and i don t mean the memes or jokes i mean the serious deep motivational quotes about what it means to be a hero you have the classis with great power comes great responsibility of course another great one was i guess one guy really can make a difference nuff said it is short and sweet it boils the message of these movies down to a bite size package and to think that one was from spiderman said during a stan lee cameo of all things maybe that s the most genuine wholesome stan cameo of them all not a joke or a gag but stan speaking directly to peter with words of wisdom remember we wouldn t have any of these great stories and heroes without stan one guy who managed to make a difference to hundreds of thousands of people who view his characters as inspirational heroes but i agree with you mark that aunt may s hero speech in spiderman is really powerful i believe there s a hero in all of us that keeps us honest gives us strength makes us noble and finally allows us to die with pride even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most even our dreams she is essentially elaborating further on uncle ben s message to be responsible means as she said to be willing to give up the thing we want the most to do what s right i think hearing that helps peter realize the value in what he represents to other people sometimes it is fun to stop purse snatchers and hear people cheer when he shows up but that is all fluff what actually matters is that regular people look up to him for all his weakness and flaws he has managed to inspire people to strive to be more heroic that is worth all the sacrifices he has to make because it is bigger than him he has the opportunity to build other people up and make them into heroes too,0
want me to tell you another thing that s wrong in the train fight scene that you won t be able to unsee at some point doc ock throws peter behind him which is the direction where the train is heading the speed of the train plus doc ock s throw force should be added and thus peter should be several carriages ahead of doc ock however what happens is really dumb after peter is thrown he threads the needle and then when he comes out of it he is behind doc ock and then doc ock gets hit and they go to the side of the train,0
referring to the aunt may garage sale scene i once heard when you re dying it s hard on everyone around you and sometimes even though you re the one going through the suffering the ones you love round you suffer worse even if you know what s going to happen staying strong and comforting those around you will be more of an impact then you could imagine i saw it as very selfless but i understand now after a recent matter with a family member who stayed strong accepting their terms and gave new hope to us it helped us move on and to look forward to a brighter future with a stronger tomorrow wishing we could do the same to those who follow it might be the end of my world but it isn t the end of yours,1
lmao best gfuel add ever xd,1
not a gamer just here from videos by pewdiepie and philip defranco showing support to a content creator,1
my favorite film is spider man,1
i really hope toby is in no way home,1
i love all the characters in this series,0
mark in december of i lost my mom to covid as a kid in his beginning s it changed me in a way i had never even thought of it endowed me with a sense of responsibility and a call to action that i often relate the original spiderman movie to on the rd it had officially been a year since i lost the lost important person in my life but it felt like it s only been a few days i barely remember anything that has happened this year in fact loss is a very hard thing to deal with and i pray you never have to grieve alone thank you for your hard work and the obvious and amazing passion you put into your videos,1
this is awesome keep it up bud,0
you don t sound crazy at all when you said you needed to watch spider man i felt and still feel the same way about gurren lagann a few years ago the message it was trying to say finally hit since then i ve viewed it almost as an anti depressant,0
ok thank you goodbye now,1
the extreme high quality of your content is amazing pls keep up the good work love from overseas,0
noice,0
it s unfortunate that certain events has sent the retrospective spiraling out of control i m hoping this shit gets cleared up quickly for you man stay strong,1
awesome vid,1
i clearly can recollect being in the theatre having the time of my life watching spider man it was amazing and i remember when peter slapped mj even as a kid i was speechless because it went against every thing i knew that peter was and it got me to realize how low he had gotten i didn t know anything about venom and so to me i liked spider man s cool black suit and how it made him strong and more confident then seeing his slow descent into that moment and then the immediate scene after of peter at the bell tower damn i was totally immersed this movie is the bomb,1
you ll get your spider man movie when you fix this damn door,0
your love of spider man in these movies makes me recognise further what i love about superman for the same reasons i really feel like if they ever do get back to making superman movies the raimi spider man movies are the real template they should aim for,1
me after i make my initial d stop motion and get copyright claimed because of the eurobeat,0
found your channel due to daniel green s post sorry for what that company is doing to you i really did enjoy this breakdown of the spider man movies sam toby editions,1
love you and your companies work mark,0
thank you for making this video as i m now and still have a lot of time to appreciate things more in my life and this series of films being one of those your video accurately describes these films and honestly brought tears to my eyes i have loved spiderman for as long as i can remember and sam raimi captured the vision of the man behind the mask almost perfectly in my opinion showing that even a person with powers can feel such strong emotions like resentment hatred or even the feeling of giving up in times of desperation just makes me love spiderman even more thank you for this amazing video,1
green goblin killed himself doc ock sacrificed himself harry sacrificed himself eddie killed himself flint drifted away the only villain spider man killed in this entire trilogy was the dark reflection of himself,0
,0
and it s all generic spider man movies from here,0
i think its intresting how you talk about how spiderman doesn t give much expressions because of the mask covering his face and tom holland mentioned the same idea on his hot ones interview,1
great video tobey is also my spiderman,0
this video was phenomenal and made me think about aspects of these movies i ve never thought about before,0
lmfao the sponsor,0
joez diaz whaaaa,0
don t even watch any of your shows you react too but hopefully like alot of us were here for you during this but dam i was not expecting this only minutes in so far and dam this is some great editing writing and commentary will definitely keep an eye out for more stuff like this,0
how did i miss this,1
,0
the was probably the funniest and greatest product placement i ve ever seen holy hell this channel is underrated,1
thank you for putting this together well done had to comment because of your love for aunt may,0
if you really liked this movie i hope you give the muskateer a chance and oliver twist bbc miniseries a chance the one with tom hardy and if you like those movies i could go on and on and on just let me kno bro,0
i laugh at the face of anyone who dares to say these movies are only good due to nostalgia,0
hope this helps,0
i liked andrew garfield he had the most swag,1
best thing from the comics i like is when doc gets his mind in parker s he doesn t know how much he holds back so when he punches for the first time he almost knocks off the head of scorpions body he didn t get a good swing and just rips his jaw of with a single punch,0
damn it hit me in the feels why don t ya,0
unpopular opinion time toby maguire isnt a good actor,0
i love the rd movie and everything you said about it i agreed with thanks mark,0
dude i love all your videos keep doing the fantastic work that you do,1
this is a great video these movies changed my life,0
aunt may had to know that peter was spiders man,0
amazing,0
great essay,0
imo tobey maguire is my absolute favorite cause feels more like spider man from the comics andrew garfield is a great actor but he was a terrible choice from spider man tom holland is probably the perfect casting choice for spider man but his character isn t written well,1
the fact that rosemary harris is years old makes me really really sad,1
solid video as usual,0
there will never be better super hero movie other then spider man and there will never ever be better spider man other then tobey maguire,0
maturing is realizing that mj was toxic,0
this video was amazing enough said,0
we watched them sooooo many times amazing movies where is this scene from where he is in a spiderman suit i actually really enjoyed spiderman from the beginning especially because of a edgy peter parker and the whole trouble between him and his best friend didn t even knew it is the black sheep in the series,0
hmm can t agree with your rating of the third movie the analysis of its message is correct but the execution of the movie is so bad that it just doesn t come across naturally unless you are actively reaching for scenes to try and find it character motivations are weak the rewrite of uncle ben s death is exceptionally stupid and only serves as a vehicle for oh we need peter to hate this random dude that turns out to be a major villain for him the amnesia you touched on this already but still it s a garbage plot point the convenience of the symbiote falling literally a few feet from where peter is hanging out with mj few things in this movie really happen because of a main character s choice they happen because convenience oh it s a bird he ll fly away when we start this machine before turning on an experimental machine that flint just so happened to be around and fall into symbiote that clings to peter s bike and waits for days weeks before attaching itself to peter butler that just so happens to have cleaned the body of norman and failed to mention that his death was caused by his own glider which still doesn t mean that peter didn t have a hand in it like he could ve used the glider i legit could go on it s not just a mess of a movie it s a bad movie it has enjoyable moments and because we re already invested in the characters due to spider man and spider man it s easier to overlook some of these issues i don t think the concepts of the movie are bad i don t even think having the amount of villains is the problem marvel has shown that having multiple characters to focus on can work well if its written well but it shows that raimi didn t really care too much about the story of this one because he was forced to insert venom which he didn t care for not that the writing in spider man and spider man is stellar save from some really well written scenes but the third movie feels like it s written by a novice,0
what a load of shit with that costume section aahahahhaha,0
spidey was and still is my favourite western character because he is relatable and not a mary sue gary stu came here from joey,0
a nitpick i always had for the train fight is when peter has to suck under the bridge wtf did doc oct do,0
why willem dafoe used mask it s because he way scarier without mask,0
tobey maguire is my favourite peter parker tom holland is my favourite spiderman into the spider verse is my favourite spiderman movie and j k simmons is an absolutely perfect casting for jj,0
ggs btw you had me right up until the end i actually think in particular is the exact opposite of your conclusion it s not that the greatest lesson is our capacity for goodness as a matter of fact it takes the hero of the last two films to show that even the paragons among us are just as capable of the things that would make you call anyone else a villain the lesson is our capacity for growth and change and in that change we grow with our ideals and values harry shows that with that growth those ideals can be flipped on their head in both directions,0
i m going to be honest i actually don t like aunt may s performance as much as everybody else does in this trilogy aunt may is supposed to be a point of guidance for peter someone he can look to when the times gets rough so when aunt may straight up abandons him whenever he s emotionally destroyed near the middle of the nf movie it comes off totally out of character not only that but there are multiple times in this trilogy where she comes off as rude to multiple people whenever that completely goes against how aunt may actually behaves in the comics,0
so well interpreted,0
spiderman greatness spiderman responsibility spiderman power,1
i really appreciate all the work that you put into these videos your love for the art you review and your dedication to the steady research behind all of these topics provide you with wonderful in depth analysis and it really shows,1
glad to see you man,1
i realized that the roles of protagonist and antagonist switch at the end of spider man an antagonist is someone who makes the protagonist act and sometimes roles can switch when you have a good movie you can break down everyone s antagonists not just the main protagonist s antagonist peter s and harry s antagonist is otto mj s and otto s antagonist is peter peter is who makes otto act,0
i loved the analysis of the origin story the focus on peter s reluctance being rooted in character flaws was enlightening for me,0
i feel the emotionless mask somehow adds more emotions it shows that you don t need facial expressions to show emotions i could play the the climax scenes from spider man the original without any sound but you would be able to feel peter s emotions even though you would only have his body language to take that emotion from peter and spider man both have to work together to bring down osborn and to me that s the significance of the torn mask,1
love these edits,0
we fight for mark,1
on the matter of doc ock not instantly being knocked out by any of peter s punches you have to take into account how much peter is holding back and how brutal a punch strong enough to instantly knock someone out could be he wants to bring otto to his senses not knock his senses out so badly that he gets taken to another hospital bed he s punching him in hopes of tiring otto out not knocking him out because if he knocks otto out he s completely incapable of talking him out of his streak of violence but if he exhausts him then he has a chance to talk some sense into him even in the comics this much is often apparent as shown in the few times spider man doesn t hold back such as against fisk or when otto takes over peter s body and shows to be capable of literally punching someone s jaw clean off,0
eyyyyy mr sunday shoutout nice,0
never heard of you till now with all the shit going down man but great video by you and your team will get ya as much exposure as my measly twitter followers can muster,1
i m the comics it stated peter pulls all of his punches,1
i haven t seen any of these movies sadly but now i want to i love the emotional and personal angle you took while analyzing these films and i can t wait to hopefully see your takes on the amazing duology and the mcu films soon,1
i fell in love with your channel for your dragon ball content but man it s really cool to hear you talk about spider man he s my favourite character in fiction and you re my favourite channel i enjoyed this very much,1
great video,1
its so funny how you say reviewing every spiderman yet only talk about tobeys spider,0
you lost me,1
what an amazing video,0
in my opinion they should have included the symbiote in the third movie but left venom for the next movie they could even have ended the movie with eddy brock being possessed by the symbiote to anticipate a sequel,0
i want to see garfield suited up his story is new to me very interesting and plus hes the quiet underdog,0
that s an interesting point about the mask i ve never heard someone bring that up before,0
rami didn t want to make it was a silly to the point of being a parody,0
,1
i haven t seen these films in such a long time this vid really does give me a new appreciation for this trilogy,1
i honestly dont like the maguire spiderman films almost at all and thats largely because of the performances from maguire and dunst it feels very wooden and maguire doesnt feel like spiderman should the interpretation of aunt may is really cruel from my perspective and the goofyness that comic book films can have isnt how i see these its dumb jokes and cringy lines the villains from and as well as jjj are both great but the overall writing and maguire himself just drag them down so much for me,0
it s not his mouth emoting it s his eyes you hide them you wouldn t be able to tell he s smiling,0
mark when toei removes of his videos,1
sick ad bruh,0
can t wait for andrews and toms spider man review,1
it is noted in the comics regarding peter s strength there is a point where peter dies and doc oc s conscious inhabits his body the new oc in spider man s body punches an enemy and removes a jaw doc oc notes that peter severely pulls his punches when fighting him and others as to not cause serious harm,1
i liked spider man as a kid and i still do i don t think it s a bad film,0
tobey had the best scripts which is why people think he is the best spidey but that s just wrong in my opinion tobey is to punchable he is too awkward and as spider man even when he is quipping he feels to stereotypical he even does a manly voice tom is the best actor but the material he is given just doesn t get spider man and andrew was fucking phenomenal and i think the amazing spider man is the most under appreciated film about spidey,0
was that lucy lawless with the line about hands in the first film,0
mary jane the character not kristen bell sucks in these movies,0
others have mentioned it but i want to add i think the mask being emotionless is intentional not only to make spiderman look bold and brave even when hes not but because if it was easier to see his features and emotions through the maks then it doesnt necessarily seperate peter parker from spider man what makes spider man so intrguing is how relatable he is and hes one of the few superheroes people can actually see themselves as people see themsleves under the mask even if its clearly peter parker i think they tried to bring that aspect of the costume to the liveaction version because without it it breaks the illusion that anyone can be under that mask i think the whole scene with the civilians theorizing who spider man could be demonstrates this perfectly i e i think he s a man but he could be a woman,0
i loved this video i m a lil later to the party but this really meant a lot to me to listen to some really dig deep and review this perfectly,0
andrew got done dirty by sony i like all,1
i always liked the first movie i was surprised so many people hated it,0
the part about the mask is just stupid ofc it s a mask you can t see their face which means no emotion if you had a mask that showed emotion then it would bw one of those cheap holloween masks,0
the best spider man is clearly j jonah,1
andrew is the best spiderman,0
dope,0
great vid,0
i mean lets be real the goblin s death was crazy,0
i love this video you truly touched me with this video,0
we can t see the emotion on peter s face yeah it s almost as if he s wearing a mask or something,1
,0
i think tom holland is the best,1
hey man can you make these less emotional i kinda didnt want to cry today ty,0
lets go dude poggers video,0
hey everyone talking about dancing bully peter the scene was intended why that s how peter thought cool guys act and behave his life was full of social unawareness,0
beautiful,0
please watch spectacular spiderman,0
what a beautiful analysis,1
great review,0
my favorite part of the raimi trilogy secretary mr jameson your wife is on the line she said she lost your checkbook j j j thank you for the good news,0
wonderful work tnm you truly make great and considerate content and in many ways i can relate to your previous struggle and your subsequent improvement spiderman is one of my favourites as well and i very much appreciated your take on his journey in this trilogy not always perfect but endearing nonetheless i hope you can beat this thing with toei and get back to doing what you do best my prayers are with you thank you again sincerely,0
as someone who watches alot of tokusatsu i think suits without anyway to see a face can still give a lot of emotions from the suit actors performances a lot of those shows make the suit actors over emotion all their actions in slower scenes and it really does help convey emotion close to what you would get in a scene without a helmet a lot of theses movies don t have interesting stuff going on with the body language of the heros when they are just talking in their suits which limits that suits can invite more ways to show emotion when handled right and i just don t think the spiderman movies do a great job at that in general,0
the take about the mask is not a good one imo sounds like nitpicking,1
spider man no way home is going to be one of the biggest spider man films mabye even topping the trilogy cause of how big this is we have the old actors coming back to do thier roles we have huge stakes and sacrifice like this movie is going to be very successful,0
mark trust me when i say this video hit me deeper than anything has in a long time i fancy myself a hero someone that lends a hand when those around me are in need or going through dark times recently though i ve come to understand that by constantly ignoring myself to help others i ve slipped into an abyss i ve gotten in arguments with those closest to me fought the people i swore to protect all of this because i wasn t focusing on bettering my life there s no way that you ll believe this but i am a more than natural being who understands that he s in control of a human body and experiencing things through a human consciousness by way of a human being called harry i understand that by that right my choice to live my life instead of his especially since i ll live way longer than he ever will has lead to the downfall of his character in people s eyes watching this video about my favorite super hero and hearing that you too had a revelation helped me to look deeper within myself this all strengthened my resolve to let harry live and to stop being selfish with his life to live within the context of the identity i have here on this planet and in society i can see past the curtain of reality i have power lots of power great power but it wasn t until now that i ve accepted the responsibility thank you mark your team the creators of the films and every living being on this planet i m beginning to understand harmony danzen,0
look mark i m glad you think these villains are good but that really isnt the point the point is not all of them should have been in one film you pick one villain unless its a villain established previously and establish it then,0
nostalgia is crazy and effects so many ppl also there is a lot wrong with the raimi movies but ppl will ignore most of it because they saw the movie as a kid andrew is by far the better actor of the and you can see it as clear as day anyone who references the comics on how spiderman should be clearly doesn t understand that peter isn t just a fucking nerd,0
bully maguire for the w,0
not gonna lie the way you describe shit and talk about these scenes literally can bring someone to tears like jesus,0
can someone animate bully maguire going absolutely ham on toei animations,0
i feel like venom should of been saved for spiderman or a part to spiderman and also spare venom his death so carnage can exist and let raimi have as much time as he wanted to make it,0
toby actually not that good of an actor the production directing story and villains carried these movies and made them goated toby just played the role well enough with everything else being top tier but that kind of makes it better since stan lee said the idea of spider man is that it could be anyone in the mask and toby definitely nails that not to throw a backhanded compliment but i think it worked out better for it,0
spider man isn t everyone s favorite film from the raising trilogy,1
this video took the combined effort of people to finish in a week please for the love of jk simmons i liked commented and shared,0
i fucking loved that some of the background music to this video is the soundtrack in the spider man video game,0
i really dislike spider man so i couldn t care less about that series but with what happened to you i m going to watch it all anyway because it s the only real way i have to support your channel so here i am love you mark i hope you get this bullshit with to i settled as soon as possible,1
that g fuel ad was goated,0
for spider man i think the biggest problem was sandman s origin rewriting uncle ben s death i feel like that was unnecessary and raimi should have had a different way to intertwine him with peter,0
waiting for your tasm video,0
i don t really like spider man at all and i only watched the first three movies as a kid not the other two trilogies but this was a really great video well done mark,0
love this review on a franchise i had forgotten i had such a love for your amazing shout out to those that helped you make this possible,0
who the hell equates pulling lifting strength to punching power it s not the same thing lmao,0
as a year old man i can confirm that tobey s spider man still holds up see ya chump,1
just notice spiderman had a hr m,0
hitop jake baldino and yours truly totally not mark im warmed and kindhearted to hear your thought about one of my fav childhood film and to put out words and to describe a childhood favorite even tho its daunting to have a slight thought of what if it didn t hold up im grateful,1
without spider man i don t think we d see the massive cultural presence of the raimi trilogy in the modern day there s so many memes in this movie that it immortalized the trilogy forever this couldn t have been done with the sheer quality of spider man and since things like the planet of the apes trilogy are also perfectly made but are rarely talked about because they lack the qualities spider man gave to the raimi trilogy,1
toby maguire inspired a lot to pursue film school,1
from hitop films jake baldino and yours love the thoughts and the capability to describe our fav childhood films,1
loves totally not mark loves spider man especially the raimi trilogy not bad,0
yeah the thing about the mask is true but it can be done just look at the mandelorian,0
i fully support mark switching to covering marvel if the toei situation doesn t clear up,1
looking at how spiderman is rated really shows how people just follow what critiques said back in it got on rotten tomato thats worse then black widow thor dark world the list goes on people really need to rewatch the movie and form a new opinion,0
the fights with doc you could argue that because the arms are in control of his nervous system they are also in control of the pain that he actually feels,1
came from cr tikal i m not a huge anime fan but great vid and i may check out your hunter x hunter stuff,1
bone saw is ready is a quote i have heard used at least once a year,0
lmaooooo,1
god i love these movies so much,0
,0
dont care what any one says or thinks the raimi trilogy will always have a special place in my heart,1
this was beautiful man,1
there s so much sam raimi gets right with spider man that i feel gets lost in future versions and more modern marvel films,0
that add with tom as a voice over was genius,0
leaving a comment for the algorythym keep scrolling,1
spider man is the best spider man movie,1
venom is also suppost to represent addiction hence him dancing and saying all this stuff he woudnt say is like drinking too much and you gain false confidence and you make questionable moments like hit a woman someone who doesnt have a ego and is humble can turn to make himself a douche but someone who already has a ego hatred can amplify that hence eddie brock and he died trying to get it back cuz he coudnt live without it and of your a young kid and start drinking its worst then you imagine,1
spider verse is my favourite because it is the ultimate fusion of the three spidey trilogy and more,0
you re the guy who had of your videos removed unfairly right sorry about that,1
this was an amazing review thanks,1
okay nice review or whatever but the mute thing is honestly the stupidest thing i ve heard all week long,0
i m sorry mark,1
you know it s bad when hollywood is treating your spiderman videos better than toei is with your one piece and dragon ball content,1
i feel my father figure was one of the best superheroes mainly because he represented that nobody is perfect that nobody is completely good that not everything we do is for a good reason and that people arent always just heroes that we have both good and back emotions and once those mix they create an anti hero a great human that can do great things that even superhumans can have human emotions like for example anger resent sadness happiness and the want to do whats right i learned by looking up to him that its ok to use bad things for good even anger that just because you feel like a monster doesnt mean you have to act like one or that you are one that is why wolverine is the best superhero to me,1
that mask argument was so stupid in my opinion,0
what a masterful review of an iconic superhero movie trilogy i never realized until now how the themes of dealing with responsibility putting others needs before ourselves and overcoming negativity through our community or our close ones created thematic parallels between peter and each of the villains in the trilogy i also loved your analysis on peter s character arc and it made me appreciate mary jane and aunt may s characters more than when i saw these movies for the first time felt so emotionally resonant that it renewed my inspiration to try my best and keep going after almost giving up to keep going in difficult times is hard but not impossible thank you for inspiring the hero in us when we needed it most,1
someone you thought was invincible reduced to a shadow of themselves reminds me of my father figure growing up the year was one of the worst years of my life and for one reason that reason is because my father figure died in that year if your an x men fan youll figure out who im talking about by the movie title ever since ive stopped playing the role of that characterin a game a couple years back ive alot of the times felt powerless like even my anger i was trained to use to use against the bad ones couldnt even do anything now ive lost the hold of my anger especially ever since ive fully took on gaming sometimes to do what s right we have to be steady and give up the things we want the most even our dreams that hits close to home for me it feels like the quote is telling me that to do whats right i have to give up gaming and my anger which makes me feel powerful,1
i won t ever have a bad opinion of this film i watched this as young adult not as a kid i always wanted spiderman to come to film i watched the nicholas hammond ones as a kid and still remember the music to till this day from then i always wished that they made a live action one where he swung through the new york skyline so when this was made i was so glad and still till this day no other spiderman beats this toms spiderman is trash and has no heart or soul its basically a ironman movie with spiderman title,0
this is that video where ill be coming back from time to time,1
love the vid obviously but about the spidey v doc oc fight spidey holds back alot like a lot a lot there s a comic that dropped a while back superior spider man where oc took over his body and saw how much after throwing one punch spiderman doesn t want to kill or even hurt anyone it captures in one frame that if he isn t careful he can rip even metahumans to pieces tldr even knocking someone out when avoidable is potentially life threatening,0
not even a question not even a doubt tobey spiderman is the best no doubt,1
beautiful mastahpiece to say the least i loved and always will love spidy cuz he s a human after all he suffers from the severe pressure and torment that s called life as well like all of us,0
d,0
regarding the part where you re talking about spider man possibly pulling his punches against doc oct we can t confirm he is in the movies but in the comics it s confirmed hilariously it s doc oct that realizes that in the superior spider man comics,0
these are the movies with the most meaning and why they will always be my favourite superhero movies,0
comment for effort,1
this video make my left ear feel good,0
i would be ok if more of these videos were done instead of things that betray you i think a community post asking us what we want to see might be a good idea,0
spider man is cool,0
i love ur vid but please watch cosmonaut variety hours video on the sami trilogy because it makes me love the movie more but i rated the movie worse,0
fantastic video man loved it,0
you re going to win this mark you re one of the most creative best content creators end of discussion,1
what a great fucking video dude impressive to say the least,1
lucy lawless is fucking mommyyy,1
dude the scene where aunt may gave peter the always brings a tear to my eyes it reminds me of my grandmother so much,0
not what i expected but i love that you re reviewing this excited to see the video,1
holy shit i lost my grandma to cancer in march of too small world my sincerest condolences,1
can u maybe review the spiderman ps game i think the story is a movie on its own it ll be amazing if you do,0
amazing work,0
hopefully you do a x men version of this when the mcu introduces them,1
u put all our reactions to these movies straight into words brother thanks for the passionate content man,0
one of the few times i didn t skip an ad read,0
your mask issue i think is solved in the spider man games on playstation they did a phenomenal job getting him expressing with that mask on,1
i think comparing the train scene from maguire to the ship scene from holland is disingenuous maguire s scene is meant to be his peak whereas holland s scene is meant to be his lowest point the parallel is intentional as it really shows just how far holland s spider man has to go as his idea of heroism is completely tied to his spider man identity and it s not as much about the people as it is about being a hero his entire arc in the movie is being a hero because it s his responsibility not because he wants to maguire s spider man has this scene be his defining moment as a hero as he s ready to accept the responsibility of being a hero holland s spider man has this scene as the complete opposite and while it s intentional i think comparing them as you did is disingenuous to holland,0
subbed anyone that judges the entire trilogy fairly instead of just saying spider man sucks is a friend of mine haha just made a video essay about the nd movie on my own channel if anyone wants to check it out also i hope everything works out for your channel my man,0
wow great work mark just came after work its am and i still watched the whole thing love your job keep on doing it mate greetings from poland,0
honestly i love every ounce of work from the research to the sponsorship this was wonderful,0
just watched the first spiderman and that movie was so boring wasn t bad but so boring tom holland is the best because he is good at both peter and spiderman nostalgia won t be apart of me,0
wasn t sure i d be in to the non anime content but after the bull that toei pulled on you i gave it a shot cause you and your team are great creators wasn t disappointed in the slightest and im really looking forward to the rest,0
broooo you hit the fucking nail on the coffin i need to rematch this movies this what superhero movies should give especially spiderman their is a hero in all of us this new superhero movies are missing that writing of heroism and what that means,0
i ve had a full size spider man movie poster on my wall for years the one with doctor octopus reflected in the lens of spidey s mask great great video,0
andrew did an amazing job and should have gotten more votes but tobey is absolutely the winner,0
so from what i heard toby made the best peter parker but andrew did the best spiderman while tom holland did the best as both,1
the raimi trilogy is really crap,1
i bet a lot of people choosing tom are younger folks who started with the avengers and his movies and probably haven t seen the older spiderman movies no hate towards tom but na tobey all day,1
osborne was right,0
i think a main problem with tom holland s spiderman is how much the mcu has streamlined the hero the mcu doesn t have enough time to go in depth into peter s origins hell they don t even have uncle ben they just go right into the good stuff the spiderman part of it,0
the video was really worth the time i spend watching it,0
i honestly theorize that the reason spider man aged as well as it did was because we got much worse super hero films since then and those successors don t have a fraction of the heart that it had despite it s flaws,1
you know how much i sacrificed,1
anyone else cry the whole time watching these,0
totallynotmark aunt may is a hero she saved me from depression she has the best acting in the franchise cosmonaut variety hour aunt may is a joke,0
can t wait to see the movie,0
it s not that andrew garfield is a bad actor we just didn t like hiw his character was written and think he could be a lot better in no way home and get a chance to truly shine,0
amazing review of the trilogy,0
i don t think spider man was trying to hurt doc ock when he was fighting him,0
i remember watching tobey s movies in theaters,0
yay good,0
that was the best g fuel plug i ve ever seen likely still will never try it but bravo sir lol,0
spyder man is my favourite super hero because he feels like the most basic super hero his name is something man all his nemesis feel like the villain of the week his morality is the basic of super heros yet his stories are still better than most modern super heros and gives very good life lessons that most modern super hero stories nowadays lack,1
,0
if only octavius first name was mike mike ock giggity,1
oh a movie review wasn t expecting that gonna do marvel or heck go to games and do minecraft or something oh god that ad s amazing,1
really enjoyed your analysis of the original trilogy from the s,1
,0
andrew is my favourite,0
im glad to hear your father is doing well i lost my father july of this year i miss that man so much i use the lessons and advice he gave me to keep going and making the most of everyday for my mother my siblings and myself i hope anyone reading this has a blessed day and keeps their head up keeping doing for those you love and yourselves,0
made me cry man,0
that is the best g fuel ad i have ever watched,0
i don t really get that mask one the mask is supposed to hide their identity and expressions it hides his fear or doubtful maybe looking face during a battle fight i personally feel like expressions thru the mask wouldn t work that well especially with live action drawing are way different and easier to draw expressions it s way harder to express emotions thru the mask even without the shield plus it works better because the actor has to work more with their voice in conveying emotions,0
the only thing wrong with spiderman is really the symbiote peter acting cool and venom was reallly meh if they changed those around a bit it wouldve been amazing,0
i think the issue of the emotionless mask is enhanced by the fact that tobey s line delivery lacked in a lot of scenes like he never really sold that spidey confidence whereas garfield who still had a rather emotionless mask was able to emote the excitement the pride the joy the worry the sarcasm of spider man through his vocal and body performances,1
bad take on the mask,1
man i love your content you sound so patient talking about this stuff i forgot i enjoyed i want to look at these movies again,0
tobey maguire is the greatest spider man ever,0
man you are a hero for making this video hang in there man,1
honestly i enjoyed the first film more than spider man the mj romance really kills the film,0
what was great about the raimi spiderman films and the schumacher burton batman films is that new york gotham have their own personality locations in other superhero films lack that even the holland garfield movies,1
i totally understand what you mean about the suit in the comics you can always tell what spidey s thinking is based on how the mask is shaped especially in the eyes,0
oh,0
didn t realize you were branching out into reviewing the live action spider man movies cool,1
totally not mark s great filler arc,0
tobey maguire will always be the real spiderman,0
make an analasis on the matrix trilogy that will be very interesting,0
man the green goblin was such a great villain,1
talkin about the legendary scene of the train fight,0
amazing breakdown man i m speechless,0
there has never been a comic book fight scene better than the train scene,0
are the green goblin actors actually related lmao,0
you said august but yet you put that poll up last week,0
aunt may definitely knew peter was spider man in that scene in spider man,1
fantastic video,0
i have a father his name was ben parker,0
never was a fan of tobey i m not finna be blinded by nostalgia,0
people say the problem with this movie was too many villains yet still cheer for or more villains in no way home,0
in retrospect every ramie fillms better then all the new disney films and the disney films are slightly better then the garfield films anyhow jesus saves everyone in the end the lake of fire is not forever see links below for proof death is real those that die have no consciousness whatsoever there is no afterlife ecc psalm psalm psalm psalm psalm acts isaiah genesis lamentations psalm matthew see below for biblegateway link however years ago a man named jesus was born he was the son of god god who always existed begat jesus jesus did not always exist first there was the father god then came his son jesus really is gods son jesus has been given office and title and powers of god god the father always had these jesus did not that is why god the father gives these things to jesus but he is not the same being as his father one is immortal and could never die the other is mortal and can die jesus before he was borne made everyone jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross as a substitute for you and all the bad deeds you have committed in your life these bad deeds are called sins we are all sinners and the wages of sin is to suffer and eventually die days and nights later after being totally dead he ceased to exist and was in a lifeless corpse in a tomb god raised him back to life and jesus ascended into heaven thanks to this he defeated death and sin once and for all for everyone since he was sinless he could die in your place jesus on that cross paid for all mankinds sins the father has accepted the payment everyones sins have been paid for hence all are saved at this momment though not all are justified declared not guilty sinless justification is for all and upon all who believe eventually everyone will believe some sooner others later thanks to this everyone will one day attain immortality and enter into the kingdom of god the lake of fire exists for some but it is not forever gods judgements are measured in the end jesus saves all the cross grantees the salvation of everyone who ever lived we have no free will god gives faith to anyone he chooses in the end he will give faith to all proof that hell is not forever the reason it says so in most bibles is a mistranslation of the words olam aion aionios start here then go over to the gospel section at the end the pages are out of order what happens to us when we die we cease to exist dead people are not conscious whatsoever the rich man and lazarus is a parable here is an explanation of the parable why certain doctrines contradict the gospel trinity free will eternal torment going to heaven hell immediately after you die instead of waiting for the resurrection the immortality of the soul ignore his denial of the prexisence of jesus i disagree with him on that otherwise he is solid predestination free will and the problem of evil we have no free will god is in control of our wills god created evil however evil will not last forever once evil has served its job it will be done away with the good it produces will last forever sin and justifcation believers are justified they can not sin because they are dead to the law god does not count their sins anymore this was not something taught by jesus when he was alive this was reavealed only to the apostle paul other general links the guys below teach the gospels truth i can be wrong about this but this is what i currently believe first link explains the gospels lists youtube channels that teach this stuff the guys below mix the two gospel into one but their is much truth here save the links to a notepad documents and bookmark them for further reading,0
i know everyone hates on andrew but y all when that moment near the end of tasm if you know your know he made that scene so powerful it was so amazing,0
made me fucking laugh so hard,0
tom holland is basically fan service spider man now,0
thank you for making this video,0
so hes emotionless beacuse his mouth doesnt move that makes no sence bro,0
i laughed so hard when green goblin droped the kids and mj and he goes after mj and it just shows the kids dropping hes like fuck thease kids lol,0
spider man is my favourite fictional superhero too i m happy to see how much he s loved by others spider man is the goat,0
this also really hits close home too all of those problems ups and downs spiderman had i can relate to that soo much specially during this pandemic i m still struggling to get prior to the pandemic losing many this year many hard choices i had to make so yes spiderman was the movie i needed him and sorted inspired me to keep going this is why i love toby as spider man,1
toby maguire changed everything he is spiderman he is the classic spiderman he is amazing they defanitly still hold up accept the rd one it s kinda silly,0
the spiderman music got me hyped for nwh,0
you can t feel the main power of spiderman his webbing only in san raimi spiderman it makes me pay attention to it,0
nice,0
hey mark get on rumble and put all your videos youtube has taken down on there,0
if i m being honest spider man isn t a masterpiece but it gets way more hate than it deserves but i m glad people are finally seeing how good it is mostly because of memes,1
the first movie i saw in theatres was spiderman when i was in the first grade with other kids and my teacher i still have my spiderman blanket from when i was and i m now i ve had posters toys so many damn toys like construction and police spiderman for some reason literally a big part of my childhood and continues to be so and i hope for much more,0
sometimes i see a movie or youtube video or even a youtube short and i think to myself o wow what a great movie video short and then i look at the comments and they re all oh it was so bad worst thing i ever saw and then my opinion starts to change towards that movie video short and i end up agreeing with the majority i just watched the third film literally yesterday because i wanted to catch up for no way home and i loved it i thought it was the best one of the three then i came here and realized that not everyone likes it but i refuse to let everyone s opinions dictate mine i still like it maybe that s what happened with this movie i have no idea because i literally watched it yesterday but maybe when it came out some critics slandered it and everyone just went along with the majority honestly my only problem with it was that venom wasn t really fleshed put enough like i don t think they even said the word venom in the movie and we never got to hear his voice but i did like bully maguire it was pretty funny until he started making huge mistakes which was i think what we re supposed to think anyway i plan to keep my own opinions for the future and to stop caring what the public opinion is ty and have a great day,0
thanks i needed that,1
that s what i love about the playstaion spider man games they made the mask more expressive and that makes it more engaging with the player,1
your expectancy for spider man and disappointment after initially seeing it was me straight up lol the mishandling of venom still bothers me too this day still haven t seen it again after seeing the midnight showing now i kind of want to see it again lol,0
i remember my best friend in middle school was in love with james franco and when spider man initially came out she tried to basically explain to me exactly what you did about harry being a real hero but i never bought it back then i definitely do now,1
who else loves spiderman outta any spidey movie no just me ok,0
fun fact i bought a used version of like mike and was super excited to watch it because it was when i first started to find my love for basketball but when i got home the first spider man was actually in the box instead lmao frickin blockbuster,1
why is audio missing for some of the scenes lol,0
for me i actually like this i allways had a thing for mute expresionless characters that communicate and express themselves with actions and body lenguage that s why i prefer mask were the mouth is not visible i don t like when you put a spiderman mask and you can see your own lips is just not the same it gives a little mistery and allows for different approches in comunication i olso like when i cartoons or c mics the eyes move like i they were real,0
i never thought about how when tobey talks we don t see his mouth move at all and now i can t unsee it and it bugs me lol,0
spider man perfect superhero origin movie spider man perfect movie at least to me,0
a thing i like about spider man is that until the last act peter generally always has his villains on the back foot in fights he has movies and half a decade of experience fighting as spider man but his villains have just got their abilities peter has such a skill advantage when he get s jumped by harry he accidentally puts him in a coma when he goes and fights sandman in the sewers he kicks the everliving shit out of him albeit with the symbiote even the first fight against sandman peter isn t getting the shit kicked out of him like he usually does he just gets caught off guard by his opponents abilities giving his enemy the chance to escape,0
nicholas hammond,1
that doc ock transition lead in caught me so off guard,0
commenting for the algorithm must ve been hard to do this in a week,0
what an amazing way to use lee as the last quote of the video he created them so he should have the last word,1
minutes,0
spiderman would have been better without sand man harry s amiseure instead harry should have teamed up with venom and tried to kill him mj and peter should never have broken up or fought but in the final act mj should have given her life to safe peter from getting stabbed by the glider which made harry snap out of his revenge and help peter kill venom then time travel gets introduced in the th movie and she comes back to life in the th movie sandman should have appeared with the vulture as a new duo,0
that marvel spider man music in the background hits different during an emotional scene infact this entire video was very awesome and emotional thank for doing this what a great gift,1
wait what happened to the dragon ball super reviews don t tell me they re gone,0
i do disagree about the mask its what differentiates this side of peter and hides his identity to others and through tobey s voice acting and the physical acting for example in that sandman scene in the tunnels what does it matter to you anyway everything was perfect,0
when you say it all the spider man movies i thought you were viewing all the spider man movies including the obscure ones,0
to be honest the spiderman peter parker from the marvel s spiderman on playstation is my favorite spiderman he s really mature yet really childish at the same time he throws jokes mid battle and his voice is perfect,0
i think the same about the train fight but when you think about it it s just lkke the green goblin fight its someone he has a connection with he wants them to stop on their own accord not with him beating them down but to show them the error in their ways,0
best story of spiderman peter parker ever i related to this character before goku i m sharing this to my brothers that has spiderman spirit but life can turn them in green goblin auto octavius and venom but even further carnage thanks again for this message even before the mcu movie comes out,0
agree w the take on aunt may rosemary harris was absolutely amazing in her performance i remember crying as a kid when she had the money discussion,1
spider man is the only tobey maguire spider man movie that s good come at me,0
honestly seeing the review of spider man it made me cry that movie was so damn good honestly better than i remember for sure,0
your complaint about the suit s inability to show facial expressions is common problem with superheor movie suits in generl you bring up the drawings from the comics but the drawing style they use in the comics fits the body more like body paint than a suit made out of the material in the movies you simply cannot replicate a comic book costume with out using padding and that includes mcguire s head in this movie others wise it would look terrible,0
bro wtf is youtube doing to your channel,0
i just rewatched the original just solidified the og movies are the best and spider man is still my favorite one,1
the suits design was specifically made because of the digital cameras at the time i don t remember the problem exactly but i believe it s because they had a problem with blurring red and blue the silver webbing helped reduce that blurring and keep the cameras focus don t quote me on that i don t remember where i learned that because it was a decade ago when i did,1
ah yes the best one and only,1
man your speech at around minutes i feel that,0
tom holland is literally the human cringe,0
this hit me like a truck just like years ago,0
ayo tobey is my favorite but i think andrew is better than tom holland honestly the last time he was a good spiderman was in infinity war,0
you will hit k by the new year,0
i enjoy watching your videos on topics i enjoy because of how perfect you seem to put the words together to persuade the audience but on occasions this video got me emotional i salute you i needed this,0
best gfuel add love the video too,0
i think there is a happy medium to be found in a mask like deadpool s which works like a regular mask with cgi being used only on the eyes to give him more cartoony expressions honestly i hoped they would do something like that with tom holland s costume but they used too much cgi on the costume,0
this is poetic bro,0
spider man is my favorite superhero too i m and soon i will be and i honestly dont know what to do with my life yes i have a job but my future is a total darkness spider man to me is a character that i can relate to more than ever his strugles are my strugles his ralationships mine too his just an ordinary human with amazing abilities he isn t some billionaire or some god trying to blend in with us although i love both batman and superman he always strives to do the right thing but makes mistakes life is full of pain and sorrow to me it seems its more pain than happiness but its that journey that makes it worth it as painful and difficult it is we always find a way to smash through to see the light in the void to find hope spider man peter parker embodies that and i m grateful that i saw them again in your video whatever i feel down or stressed i always remember that with great power comes great responsibility,0
interesting opinion about the eyes because concept art and even some test masks made for the first movie show the eyes with either see through lenses or dark yellow tinted variants it looks really cool and i think it makes for a very unique take on the mask like he used sunglasses just like the alex ross art or tasm suit,0
too bad reported for violent and repulsive content too many cooks spoils the broth too many villains spoils the movie,0
i feel like tobey is the best compared to the other two each one has their own distinct thing that i like like toms child like attitude embodies peter and andrews quick one liners are hilarious but tobey is the foundation i love how peter not only juggles being an adult like paying bills having a job having a relationship while also juggling being a hero was always more reliable to me,1
hey can you review the mcu someday,0
lucy lawless s cameo was great,0
spider man is the best one,0
loved this keep it up,0
i know it s memed to hell but when he was struggling to stop the train tobey really sold that shit tho that shit was so hype,0
bro you made me cry talking about aunt may,0
my dad also got very sick during unfortunately he didn t pull through it was brain cancer and i had to watch his mental state deteriorated to that of a giant infant i also lost my cat and my tarantula before this that same year so i feel you there,1
great video,0
the lady who says he is hot is actually lucy lawless aka xina lol,0
funny about your complaint about the mask because i believe it was dafoe who requested that the goblin helmet had retractable eyes to get his emotion across for his performance,0
great review i love the ps spider theme in the background an amazing tough,0
mark says he s but we all know he s and lying just to get the title of daddy,0
i want to i want to i want to i want to i want to beee a part of it new yooork neeeew yooork,0
ok hot take but in the raimi movies aunt may definitely knows,0
such an amazing vid edit pls like the vid guys,1
spoiler during the superior spider man run when doc ock takes spider man s body he punches the jaw off a villain and realizes peter has been holding back this whole time spoiler,1
spidey always pulls his punches even in the comics doc oct figures that out when he takes peter s body in the superior spiderman also spiderman does have the best rogues gallery,0
one theory i heard regarding spidey fighting doc ock is that the tentacles were numbing the pain every time spidey threw a punch preventing doc ock from feeling anything,0
best trilogy review i didn t think i d watch the whole thing but it was interesting and inspiring,1
when you realize the background characters in the sam raimi spiderman movies are more memorable than some characters in the mcu,0
damn mark you brought the dramatic delivery with this one,0
ursola mj,0
i consider the second film my favorite due to peter s struggle of living two lives at once yet i never considered the change of what brought him back to being spider man again thank you for sharing your thoughts of the second film i always learn things from you haha,1
here s to hoping to get the review of the garfield and holland movies before no way home hits the theatres,0
so bully maguire was the villain all along,0
the problem with spider man is definitely venom but not the reason they think thing s were done wrong one was the casting of eddie and second they tried to do him in movie if peter got the suit in and near the end got rid of it but we didn t actually get venom till it could had worked in truth sami was right for these movies venom just doesn t work with the story he was telling,0
thank you soo much for covering these was my favorite only because of harry and how he came through for his friend in the end reguardless of what they have been through and knowingg what they knew about each other it realy speaks to me even today i still remember that melted face showing up for the clutch with the bomb sticking to sandman s hand,0
the real reason i dislike spider man is because it killed that s show,0
disclaimer none of the mcu fandoms were hurt in making of this video,1
did you know the receptionist and the bank manager in spiderman sam r are brothers because they are both sons of b,0
in terms of looks personality and mannerisms maguire was the perfect peter parker ironically his spiderman portrayal was probably the worse of the three however,0
this is one of your best videos made me cry congratulations and please keep the good work,0
loved this video man this just shows how much effort you put in saw your tweet on twitter man so sorry that your vids are all gone hope you can fix it soon,0
wonderful video man really well done this trilogy had its ups and downs but it showed us what hero s can be and how superhero movies can be about more than hero s vs villains keep up the good work,1
personally spider man was always my favourite i hadn t really read many comics but i thought spiderman as usual was cool his black suit was cool new goblin looked cooler than green goblin for me sandman was great and sympathetic and venom was spidermans demons manifested and harry dying as well as spiderman forgiving his uncles killer making it a very fitting end to their arcs,0
despite some of the flaws i love all these tobey spider man movies to me he is peak peter parker i m glad to see the third movie getting a more fair review while i never really jived with the amazing spider man films that came after and am not the biggest fan of the tom holland movies i m optimistic into the spider verse proved to be my favorite movie,0
couldn t have put it any better myself,0
i think zat spider man would be better if de only villians there were sandman and peter villian with good goal and hero with evil motives no amnesia or alien from nowhere bullshit,0
mark good seeing you trying new things,0
venom was never interesting to begin with,0
this may be my favourite marks video ever and i have been watching all his videos since he started one piece this video resonated with me alot,0
yeah in superior spider man when dr octopus got peter s body he realized just how strong peter s punches could be when he sent scorpion s jaw flying,0
andrew garfield is underrated and tom holland is hugely overrated mfer is too one note but yeah tobey is the best one by far,0
practically how does one fix the mask situation cut the shell near the mouth area perhaps to allow lip flaps,0
she was ahead of its time lmao,0
bro whaaaaat hold up man what that who are you contrast from the first and rd movies was sick,0
can we see ur own art work of spiderman,1
now do andrews and hollands spider man,0
thank you so much for your beautiful essay,0
that g fuel ad threw me off so hard,0
i m gonna say what s been said from a million different people spider man should ve been split into introduce sandman the black suit and eddie this film have most of the stuff with harry stay the same and cap it off with peter ditching the black suit then we can have open with mysterio bruce campbell being stopped by peter and have him learn from the black suit to boot drag out his fights and try and get it done asap this leads to jameson being less bothered by spider man in some scenes and thus having less of a reason to give peter work cut about a third of the way through the movie to sandman and venom meeting and having their convo wouldn t change much just make it a bit more detailed and longer then have peter meet up with harry one more time before the big finale and talk about harry s dad the scene can end with harry accepting his dad but wanting nothing to do with peter you could even have him throw him out a window or something to really get him cemented as being like i want you out of my life get out have peter try and explain what happened to mary jane but the scene is cut off by venom beating him to a pulp and stealing mary jane away then the finale is more or less unchanged but we see harry actively make the decision to come help peter after more words of inspiration from bernard i think that s the butler s name i think that s how i would change sm and that s about it i really like emo peter and wouldn t change much really,1
agreed she is older aunt may her jk simmons were some of the best casting ever,0
did you private the dragon ball vids,0
i m sorry but i think i have to say this pizza time,0
if i m being honest even though spider man was my favorite it gave me nightmares because of the green goblin manly the way the mask was but the green goblin was still a really good villain and the newer spider man movies don t give me the same charm the older movies do,0
reminds me of a certain gladiator turned revolutionary turned tyrant who realised too late the atrocities devastation he d caused and genuinely tried to atone by joining the side he once fought against even though he went on to spend years doing nothing but help others the guilt still hung on so he was unable to pass a morality check in order to save everything luckily there were others worthy enough at that moment but it shows he can t let what he d done go granted that said atrocities were committed over million years so that s a lot of time to spend doing evil,0
chek out arcane next plz,0
the ai for the arms are in control of ottos central nervous system that s at least my head cannon supported by the arms functioning with unconscious oc and certainly also augment his own neural stability with various small pieces of scenes y to o or support this thought,0
mark your videos are something else,0
i fuckin love my boy tom love to hear his voice,0
dont tell mark about master chief,1
am i the only one who liked the dance number i loved spider man not as good as or but i didn t hate it i was shocked when i heard people hated it bad lol,0
to comment on the pulling punches in the comics there was a point where dock oc took over peter s body and the first time he used it he punched scorpions jaw clean off if he doesnt pull is pimches so much that he might lose he could kill or cripple the people he fights and he doesnt want that,0
you think that s a nitpick wait till i tell you about doc s tentacle blade lol,0
spider man pizza time mark i started to contemplate my own death,0
the hero of many and one of my favorite super heroes along side spawn,1
the second one holds up pretty well,0
maybe in spiderman develop the character eddie brock and let him become venom in spiderman,0
im really glad you decide to step into other things besides dbz your analysis on other shit is really dope,0
amazing work had me engaged the entire time you really descriptively broke down the films and the dynamics behind the characters and scene great content,0
the raimi trilogy has been and probably will always be my most loved film series i adore all movies sooooooo much,1
regarding spiderman i really do feel it was weekend by being a too many eggs in one basket situation regarding the villains i feel it should have been his original intention with having just sandman harry as the major antagonist especially because even if raimi didn t grow up with majorly attached to venom i seriously feel he could have done great with that storyline if he was able to go at his own pase given a movie on his own as central antagonist,0
can we also talk about how modern movies don t respect old people anymore aunt may and uncle ben are imperfect prideful sometimes irrational people but the films never forget to respect the wisdom and strong values that come with a long honest life experience they both are the heart of their respective films and make a tangible difference in the plot through the moral inspirational power of their actions specifically on peter rather than having the physical strength to force values on others and that extra dimension of familial mentorship is completely lost in the mcu s attempt to a force everyone who isn t a chubby comic relief character into being young and fuckable even aunt may and b shoehorn peter into being a wildly irresponsible and stupid iron man jr i don t care what anyone says this idiot tried to breathe while leaving the earth s atmosphere so that serving the wider cinematic universe is prioritized over being a compelling character on his own and the mentorship epically fails to be compelling or respectable because of how much time the mcu has spent undermining tony in civil war ultron and endgame some of its most important and large scale movies,0
i think jk simmons and then rosemary harris are the best performances in the trilogy,0
im halfway through and this feels like rose tinted glasses the movie bit further in ok so there s maybe some good emotional reasons for that yeah you set out to say only positive things about this trilogy pretty much it doesn t feel honest it doesn t feel earned it feel like you re gushing and i feel like i ve listened to a fanboy with a thesaurus for three quarters of an hour,1
how do you do it mark i ve never had another youtuber that i resonated so much in everything it s like we share the same brain synapzes all your opinions ever since the dbs reviews are literally equal to mine and like yourself i also had the exact same experiences with the sm movies i think i was more sad at the end of sm because venom died if i m being honest but also the bit with rosemary harris s speech in sm all the way to sm feeling slow at the start i watched it times in the theathers much to everyone i dragged along with s dismay i remember when they released the sm black spidey poster years before and i had to wait and didn t know how thanks a lot for this video i m looking forward to the tasm aswell as usual,0
another aspect i really love about the sam raimi uncle ben death is that it also teaches peter the difference between revenge and justice in that scene the wrestling manager has just screwed peter out of a lot of money and is clearly a sleezebag so to get back at him he lets the robber get away basically going serves you right which anyone would have felt was deserved but because of that action it leads to uncle ben s death and i feel that was really interesting because it makes a clear distinction even if you hate a person think they may disserve some action that isn t justice and you need to do the right thing and save them,0
what a lovely surprise,0
cant wait to see all of then together,0
it s funny one piece is my favorite piece of media of all time i adore your reviews of the arcs but without question i feel like this is by far your best review the personal attachment deep understanding powerful look into this trilogy legitimately wowed me and at times even made me rethink a lot of my own views on the films and certain elements within while i do tend to be more of a dc fan than marvel and while my favorite heroes are the likes of batman wonder woman spider man will always be up there he s easily my favorite marvel hero by a long shot and i tend to look very fondly on these movies because of it same with even the andrew garfield ones and the mcu films as well this review also hyped me up greatly for no way home making me more excited than ever to see the return of such amazing villain portrayals as dafoe s goblin molina s doc ock and church s sandman i can t wait to see your review of the rest of the spidey films because again this video legitimately blew me away,1
man sandman from spider man really dressed like steve from blues clues brilliant review mark,0
the best spiderman movie is into the spiderverse change my mind,0
i blame avi arad for killing sam raimi s ambition in spiderman,0
mark really wants a live action spiderman to wear a mask off amazon so you can see a couple wrinkles that let you know hes smiling,0
what a fucking video man bravo,0
the line sometimes we have to be steady and give up what we want most even our dreams really connected with me in a way i didnt expect it connected wih my current situation with my current struggles and i really respect this movie for that spider man is incredible,1
sorry but i can t watch that scene without laughing there s been too many memes of it,0
that hero in all of us segment in this video really hit me man thank you,1
always good to hear a shout out to mrsundaymovies i don t think spidey not smashing otto s skull in is a error spidey pulls his punches because he knows a full strength punch would kill him and he doesn t kill,0
so far i gotta say my favorite part of the video was the ad,0
i haven t seen these movie since i was a kid this has given me a whole new perspective on the themes of these movies i think i m gonna rewatch them with this new lens and my grown up eyes,1
bro this video is so damn good great outstanding,1
great video as always don t suppose you ll be doing anything on arcane,0
bully maguire meme is stupid,0
,0
i disagree about the costume because even though we want to see more emotion from the actor but that s not the point of the mask when people see the mask the see hope a man that is brave enough to face an opponent that no one else can even though under the mask they might be scared or uncertain that you ll win and if people see that then they will get scared too,0
no you re not wrong if venom wasn t in this movie and if the symbiote wasn t in it either this would be a perfect movie,0
beautiful,0
man i wasn t ready for manly tears at the end,0
yooo for real a spiderman movie with a jaded older spiderman played by edward norton would of and could still be awesome,0
honestly spider man has always been my favourite from seeing it when i was all the way to today to me it has the greatest villain of all time sandman the coolest looking suit the right amount of cheesy camp which is then pointed out and mocked in perfect fashion and one of the greatest fights withing the last mins if the film i ve always know this film had its flaws such as the treatment of venom but the way everything else is handled is near perfection and i could never hate it,1
damn i m in the minority andrew,0
probably because i ve always been a rich kid i never understood why so many people found peter s money issues so relatable i just liked spider man because of the powers,0
i think you re the only content creater that i can watch an hr long video through its entirety in setting great work once again,0
zb,0
great video,0
when i was a kid i always used to skip to the peter and flash fight whenever i d watch spider man,0
i can t unsee it anymore i m sorry,0
spider man is truly not that bad compared to some actual shit,0
and then the amnesia happens reminds me of another series we both love lol,1
dude i can relate so much to what you are talking about with personal issues could almost say you were telling what s happened to me in the last year as well been a rough year and its had the same effect to me as well with my own mortality,0
tobey maguire is the strongest spider man andrew garfield s spider man is most comic accurate spider man and peter parker tom holland s is the only spider man to ever get past films,1
hey mark part of your one piece review series is missing and i m just wondering what s up with that,0
i hate how much tom hollands spider man clings on tony stark,0
ill take spiderman over all the tom holland movies thats not to say spiderman is bad but i actually love that movie it kept the drama the light hearted moments the sad moments and to its core is a competent movie its not horrible as people made it out to be years later on youtube plus with the way the mcu shoehorns comedy into every damn scene tom holland movies being one of the offenders it should be forgiven with how the way people eat that shit up,0
this video makes me relive my own experience with this film franchise thank you for the emotional nostalgia trip,0
in spite of everything he thinks hes done for them why is that so funny,0
it s a neural link right the arms kept him conscious,0
the holding back on people is addressed in the comics a lot superior spiderman is actually a series were doc oc takes over peters body and he kills a man realizing how strong peter is and that he is always pulling his punches,0
yes tobey maguire number spiderman,0
i got really sick recently and to be honest the level of anxiety that came on was on precedented i started talking to my friends like i was dying it reach the point that i started accepting that my death was coming on ive been recovering but now that fear of my own mortality lingers nearby right beneath the surface every few words may trigger it and there s no way to avoid them,0
the description is inaccurate the earliest was made in so actually you couldn t have seen it over years ago,0
i prefer the editor s cut harry making the decision to trust his friends on his own is far more effective that a butler telling harry what he already suspects,0
yo that sponsorship segment was unlike any i ve seen from youtube creators,0
funfact bruce crambell was going to mysterio he was always there lurking,0
your ability to analyze plots and narritive is unlike any other i ve come to see yet i m a long time fan of your channel and i greatly enjoy your content thank you for all of your hard work,0
ah yo he used the ps spider theme,0
in lisp thanksh shtan leeeee,1
if we re talking stricte about being spiderman garfield holland maguire people either dont care about the comic book version or they are blinded by nostalgia,1
people say that we only like tobey version because of nostagia but he s one of the most grounded version of the character on screen his struggles with his life between peter and spiderman have depth and actually have an effect on the both sides of his life he works for a guy who treat him badly and hates spiderman he have bills to pay and needs to help aunt may he s working delivering pizza he s in love with mary jane and while his broke his best friend who is rich is also in love with her and the list goes on and uncle ben was the big reason on why he became spiderman none of this appears in mcu version so i must say that tobey still the best verion of the character even after so many years,1
i saw this in my recommended but i didn t realize that it was totally not mark who made this video i love this video please do more trilogy essays like this not just for superhero trilogy by any kind of trilogy or any other franchise like the captain america movies harry potter etc love the video it was a nice surprise,1
not trying to take away anyone s enjoyment but did anyone see southpaw s video on spider man it was quite eye opening i still love it regardless but a good video nonetheless,1
last year i also had started realising the concept of death im now and i feel way better but when i did it was terrifying it was nice to hear what you said about that as well,1
this is the best analysis of the trilogy ever great work mark,1
literally watched all of the sam rami spider man movies just to watch this review great decision i made,0
spiderman is a good movie,1
i was too younge too see these movies but later in i saw them and they were some of the best movies i ve ever seen p s mark once you finish naruto can you review dr stone pls,0
it actually blows my mind when you said that peter and norman are both main characters in the first movie and in one second the screenwriter in me broke the movie down quickly and realized that it s true,1
omg fine youtube ill watch the damn video,0
you are missing the best spider man movie into the spider verse,1
i broke my spider man disc by playing it so damn much,1
damn mark is i though he was maybe tbh,0
spiderman will always be my favorite in the trilogy i love so many elements of it and think it gets way too much hate,0
you do realize how manipulative mj was in spider man and right,1
did not expect to be crying watching this but here i am ur words resonated so well with me cheers mark and everyone else working on this amazing work and video,0
i think the part of emotionless mask is more lack of body language in japanese tokusatsu shows people use helmets but the actors trained a lot to convey emotion just using their body language they can really convey what the helmets are covering and that really is lacking in hollywood super hero movies that sometimes even goes the lazy way by just removing the mask of masked heroes like in x men or put a ton of inside the helmet scenes like in iron man i know facial expressions are important for acting but the movies are not fights,0
the lack of mask expressions are just cuz of the time it was made so maybe it could a little bit of a pass there,0
yooo she left a dude at the altar you don t want a girl that will do that she is for the streets,0
even though he has organic web shooters outside of that tobey maguire spider man is by far the most comic book accurate,0
lore wise spider man is so strong he can kill most people by knocking their head and spine out of their body like a mortal kombat character he is always holding back insanely hard thats why he has actual fights because he cant hold back any less or people will die,1
sam raimi himself hates spider man very openly,0
i ve watched a lot of videos of people talking about spider man before this my favourite review was the trilogy hitopfilms made for the raimi series but now this video is my definitive favourite i genuinely started crying when you were talking about aunt may s speech in spider man that scene means so much to me for similar reasons to yourself spider man took me out of a dark place and that movie continues to inspire me many times when i am struggling to go on wondering what is the point of trying i often think back to spider man i think about how peter didn t need to be spider man and could ve had a good life but he chose to accept a life of responsibility and he chose to live with the consequences everything you have said in this video is spot on and i m so glad you made it this video is a genuine piece of art,0
this video reminded me of why these films were such a high point of my childhood from relating to the helplessness of pre superpower peter then the everyday struggles of affording rent maintaining friendship relationships to feelings of inadequacy and being unable to accomplish your goals when it quite literally feels like the entire world is against you hits me now more than ever as a year old as much as i enjoyed the garfield and holland movies the raimi maguire trilogy will forever be my favourite superhero movies even more so just favourite movies overall and i will never tire of the morals ideals and genuine struggles these stories do such a fantastic job of displaying your minute moment about the declining health of your family members and the eventual anxiety surrounding your own mortality is such a universally relatable mindset i can t even stress how much as stupid as it may sound how much this video choked me up it s those kind of moments during such well thought out and in depth analysis scripts that make me keep coming back to this channel the sheer effort and genuine thought provoking dialogue these video essays instill are just absolutely fantastic thanks for everything you do mark in the words of the incredible aunt may there s a hero in all of us,1
bro norman was a man that lost everything the moment back to formula was said he snapped subconsciously he was never at odds with the goblin he only needed to see the goblin after the blackouts to see what his subconscious had done and he doesn t actually fight it he fights it,0
best minutes of my day,0
uncle ben isn t important to the original spider man stan lee andrew garfield is the closest to his personality being a jerk when he gets the power to be etc toby looks most like the real spider man and tom isn t close to the og personality wise he s more of a iron man mentee and a mcu character then the oh spider man,0
mark you may be one of if not the best content creator on this platform i love your videos and hope you keep making them,0
just getting this out there i don t like one singular spider man all of them are good sure somethings can be changed but it comes down to preference i like tom holland because he has in my opinion has the best suits andrew for the villains motivations toby for the for the story so why is there one best spidey can t they all be good tell me i m wrong,0
as an australian thank you for putting our prime minister in the montage of terrible world leaders i m doing my best to get rid of him and hold our weak opposition party accountable,0
man this is such a great video seeing you like spiderman so much really makes me think you will love monogatari series hope you review it someday and i hope ill be around to see it,0
me i shouldn t watch an hour long youtube video at am bully maguire i missed the part where that s my problem,0
omg david fincher was gonna make peter b parker,1
the very first film that i ve ever watched in a movie theater with my grandma is spider man,0
agree with everything that mark stated about all movies but i still don t like spider man that being said i probably need rewatch thet movie tho,0
lifting strength striking strength,0
i m at and i m wondering if deadpool will come up,0
i remember getting a psp back then and receiving a free copy of spiderman in umd i watched the movie at least times since i had no money for games lol so hyped for this movie hype may ruin expectations but seeing tobey again is enough for me,0
sandman s little sequence where he tries to grab the locket is really amazing too,1
guess i know what i m doing for the next hour,0
i watched and a half minutes of this video and stopped i love your videos but the serious thoughtful discussion of narrative and storytelling doesn t really work for the raimi films at least in my opinion these films are goofy campy comic book movies and watching hilariously silly clips being played over an introspective speech just kinda rubs me the wrong way i watch your videos to learn more about the nuances of storytelling and writing in general which is why i mainly prefer your positive videos and taking the same approach with these movies doesn r really work because the main reason why these films are good is because they re funny and entertaining not beacuse they re masterclasses in writing which is the kind of stuff i enjoy listening to you talk about not saying you shouldn t have made this video you can do whatever you want i just wanted to say this keep up the vids really keen on the newer art videos like the dragon ball super engoodening,0
dude you need to write a book or a movie or something your writing skills are beyond insane i was completely invested of the way through the video and i loved every second of it,0
it s normal to be afraid of death it s a sign that u care about how u live your life and that u want to live a life with purpose but that s the question what s the purpose of this life and is that purpose internal or external is there an objective reality i sincerely invite you to read the qur an an english translation is fine if you don t know arabic i personally took a comparative world religions course and found the truth in islam it s undeniable with zero contradictions it is pragmatic and provides a holistic way of life as it covers every single aspect of a human being,0
man your video made me cry amazing review,0
did i really just see an actual commercial inside a youtube video i suppose it was inevitable youtube would turn into tv,0
i don t see the connection to the fact that tasm is the best spider man movie,0
lol ngl i like that g fuel sponsor,0
i think spider man strength increase as much as his will like in the train scene he s at of his power that s why was never a problem for me him not knocking out everyone in one hit those extraordinary exemples is him beyond the limits increased by the power of will itself,0
these movies at the time where down right mind blowing as a kid nobody can take that away from us these movies set the president for comic book movies man the first movie and blade set the bar,0
i swear you can make beautiful speeches,0
man how do you manage to make me tear up cry with like every video so good,0
about doc oc taking all them punches from peter among other things in the comments below like when someone else has peter s powers they take someone else s jaw off with no effort i think the most interesting piece of info from the comics is that overtime doc oc left alive and coming to blows with peter on the regular eventually is a paraplegic he loses the use of his legs because of all the head neck and spine damage done by his fights with peter then the arms become a necessity not just a utility,0
this is why this spider man will forever mean so much too me if hes in the no way home movie i think i ll cry finally seeing my spider man once again,1
mark i never give likes to videos on youtube but my god bro you earned one from me with this video ps not goin to lie i shed a tear keep up the good work,0
agree with mark on his spider man take feel like this movie gets way more hate than it deserves it s not perfect but i grow to love it the more i rewatch it the editors cut tho of it is my preferred way to see spider man,1
the blade that pierced his body came from his glider you are so fired you knew this the whole time and you choose now to tell me i thought this would be the best time to tell you the truth i took a grenade to the face dude,1
sam raimi ok i am going to bring this movie full circle with sandman being uncle ben s killer and harry dealing with the revelation of spider man being peter parker sony sounds great but add venom sam raimi why the story is prefectly wrapped up as it is why would i add a character i had no intention of writing about at all sony moolah baby,0
honestly i wasn t too enthusiastic about a review of these films mainly dues to the fact it felt so far left field of the content i usually see from this channel as i began watching in effort to show my support for you as a reviewer but oh wow i can t believe how many times i ve watched this video already since it was released i loved it and it got me interested to go back to the movies to rewatch for myself that only goes to show that not only are you really goof at your craft but you re also great at picking content to go over i m sorry i ever doubted you forgive me my main man definitely insistently totally not mark if that s your real name,0
won der ful thank you for these video,0
shout out to tom o regan for the add read did an amazing job but also gave me a heart attack that alarm noise will be the death of me,0
that s what i ve been thinking i want a super hero movie where it shows that this is what they do on a daily basis and not only when the entire world universe is in danger,0
j,0
i love willem dafoe,0
my grandmother passed in her sleep in and its crazy because she felt it best to not let me know she was suffering when she passed i found myself lost for a few months and couldn t focus on anything it got so bad that my friends worked for months just to get me to smile a bit i look back at it and just thank god for my friends being there for me this movie just hits me on a physical level,0
the tragedy of venom s inclusion is the character actually does fit s theme of forgiveness in the comics peter actually does wrong to the symbiote who instead of a corrupting force was a alien with a innocent outlook that wanted nothing more than to serve peter and be a super hero this and bonding to eddie brock who was also a flawed heroic character led to both characters becoming villains due to their desire of revenge before ultimately forgiving peter and becoming anti heroes and the first spider man spin off character if one does not count the punisher as great as that s cartoon is it s need of to simplify the character has helped utterly warp people s perception of the character as sam would take that and then exorcise any redeeming qualities that version had resulting in a complete and total opposite in every single possible way version of who venom is and as a result venom suffered in most adaptions going forward with the exception of a few video games eddie believe or not has been a good guy for most of his life as a character it has gotten to the point that people find fault with the two great venom movies because they assume that warped perception was comic accurate while the movies instead mostly faithfully adapt venom s original s run of mini series after mini series though they do have their adaption flaws as well like with cletus and carnage s bond thats why you re completely right about spider man venom got me into comics and as such seeing the character depicted so wrongly to the point i consider this to be venom s worst ever adaption outweighs any positives the movie has for me,1
i feel like the ryan reynolds deadpool movies do an emotive mask perfectly you see all the movement of his features as he speaks and reacts to things,1
spider man is way to overhated yes it has its bad moments but i think ovrl its a movie i enjoy,0
mark the video is great i love how much time and research you put into this for this films that played a major role in my childhood since tobey was my introduction to spider man also i feel like the st film doesn t get as much love as it deserves i will forever love but i like more because of the dynamic between norman and peter that movie is the reason goblin is my favorite spidey villian sorry for the long comment,0
the youtube comment section is just the best,0
this moved me to tears thank you for another banger,0
gotta watch spider man some how makes it better,0
i know mark said he was only going to review the live action spider man movies but it would be so cool if he reviewed spectacular spider man,0
,0
do well my friend,0
someone gotta review marks cinematic masterpiece that was that gfuel segment astonishing,0
very nice breakdown of the first movie i think your complaint about the mask although with good intentions is wrongly placed although i agree that the face indent showing through the mask is beneficial for seeing the facial movements behind the fabric i feel like that would just be more annoying for the actor to wear squeezing face difficulty breathing etc even aside from that the context of the scenes and the body language play just as big a part as the dialogue in those scenes to me none of the emotion is lost or less effective as you state if anything i think it makes the unmasked scenes more impactful so i think the face silhouettes appearing stoic in the costume is actually beneficial in the grand scheme of things good to disguise your face good for viewer interpretation and great for noticing body language in general it really isn t that hard to tell or imagine what faces peter makes behind the mask in those scenes,0
why did andrew get so few votes hes the best out of all of them best acting best suit alot of character development in only movies and he is the only one thats not cringe also most atractive but ya tobey is just kinda cringe but hes still better then tom tom has had only a bit of character developmemt hes not comic acuret at all they messed up his version thye made flash just dumb made mj diffrent they just got rid of uncel ben witch lessens his actual character development like ben was why peter started to use his powers for good also they got rid of harry and ya toms spider man is just bad compared to all the others also andrew had had to deal with the death of his parents his gfs dad and his gf so ya he has some character development tobey just had to deal with uncel bens death and tom had to only deal with tony s death sure they still have some character development from that but andrew got more when you look at it,0
it s not a popular opinion but i much prefer garfield s spiderman to tom holland s mainly because even though his writing is horrible garfield tends to make the best of it so it s serviceable that s important because tom holland does make good superhero movies but not good spiderman movies because of spiderman s catchphrase he is supposed to be your friendly neighborhood spiderman all the amazing showmanship is good but spiderman isn t supposed to be a worldwide phenomenon he isn t the type to always be saving the world because he cares too much about the individuals hell he wasn t able to join the avengers at one point because he cared so much about the hulk s feelings that he couldn t bring himself to complete the entrance exam for the avengers him caring about the individuals as well as his city makes it so he loves being a simple friendly neighborhood spider man and i think that amazing spiderman shows that more than the newer spider man,0
my favorite spider man and storyline is from the spiderman video game,0
amazing video as always,0
amazing analysis makes me appreciate these movies even more,1
after watching this review it s sad that no way home is throwing otto and sandman s character development away for fan service stated before seeing the movie,0
this is my favorite video you made from the in the clouds awe of your descriptions of the movies to your painfully relatable and understandable pain of your own personal struggles this felt more than a review from a youtuber it felt like sitting down listening to some cool guy i don t really know but find pretty damn neat talk about something he loves with infinitely more preparation work and effort than just talking but it just feels real personal thank you,0
mark i think branching out from anime may actually be an awesome idea anime should definitely remain the focus but occasional la movie vids are more than welcome,0
i really feel like andrew garfield doesn t deserve the level of hate he gets bad plot writing sure but peter s characterisation and lighthearted antics as spider man are spot on,0
r i p steve ditko r i p stan lee the two men who gave us one of the greatest heroes of all time,0
spider man is still the uncontested best superhero film imo and easily my fav spider man film and wow i relate so much on a personal level where you talked about back then you only cared about the action and spider man scenes but have grown to really appreciate the more character to character interpersonal moments that is literally me,1
i think if they gave raimi what he wanted he probably would ve came around to make a proper movie with venom,0
give lsoo like stories of old s video of spiderman a look i think you ll like it he has a similar and more in depth look though it as he focuses mostly on it and not the other movies,0
the train fight has yet to be topped the choreography the directing everything about it is perfection nothing in any modern superhero film has topped it,1
andrew is still being unappreciated based off those poll results as usual i see,1
doesn t agree with cosmonaut,0
hey mark i couldnt agree more that scene with aunt may it encapsulates what makes spider man the defining hero not the strongest or even smartest a hero in the true sense also im a thanatologist i work with patients to help them understand death grief and loss these couple of years have been a transforming time in wich people have been confronted in a rough way i hope you are doing better and if there s any way that i can help with just let me know,0
i love your review but the problem is some scenes have this mono sound kinda annoying at least for me but nonetheless thanks for reviewing the trilogy that means so much to me also love that dance scene on spider man i love emo bully or whatever you call that version of tobey maguire,1
glad people are having a better look on sm i ve loved it since the only thing wrong with it to me is every thing going on is good separately it just wants to do too much in one film,0
i usually don t comment on videos but you did an amazing job on this video i love your content and appreciate your unique perspective thank you for your hard work i really do enjoy it,0
awesome spider man is goated,0
in the superior spiderman run where doc ock takes over spdiey s body he realizes that peter pulls his punches by a lot its cannon that he goes east on the villains,0
what a beautiful heatfelt truly passionate video great stuff mark keep it up man,0
lol really love how he replaces the scream with the meme scream,0
take a stando against za warudo,0
i had exactly the same experience with my grandma she passed in from pancreatic cancer rosemary harris s aunt may is so much like my grandma she was such a pure and selfless woman and was always there for me for the first years of my life aunt may is the only other person i ve ever seen who was like her and she s fictional i can t even express how much i miss her,0
tom has the better films,0
wait joey mother f ing diaz was in spider man this man is literally everywhere god that s some funny timing to contrast the sad and yet heartfelt description of what this scene means,0
next review the evil dead evil dead,1
anyone else think he s overthinking the mask part,0
for me the villains always make the movie that s why spider man are so great to me tobey maguire is off putting and weird kirsten dunst is stiff as a board and james franco couldn t act his way out of a paper bag but the villains willem dafoe absolutely commands the shot anytime he s onscreen he has such a terrifying presence and alfred molina s doc ock is easily one of the best villains of all time simultaneously portraying the affability of octavius and the relentless unstoppable drive of the tentacle possessed octopus thomas hayden church was pretty good i thought even if he does kind of unfortunately look like ernest p worrell when it comes to the later series i think michael keaton s performance as the vulture is the only one that holds up to dafoe and molina,0
something i ve always liked about is that at first otto is everything peter wishes he had a life where his mind helps people pays the bills keeps a relationship with his soulmate and all of it without spider man and then it all gets ripped away,0
oh man the original spider man video game music at the end was so nostalgic,0
you should review the ps video game,0
blue cheese w wings or go fuck ya motha,0
naruto is better than spiderman this is a waste of time,0
spidermam best anime,1
someone compared the raimi trilogy to the dark knight trilogy in so far as like they re both great reinventions of the character but versions that are pretty different from the source material they both also greatly influenced the portrayals of the characters a lot,0
i m typing these while watching the vid spiderman pulls his punches it s maybe a cop out in writing but it s a part of his character like superman a being who can crack a moon him fighting street level enemies and not killing them it s part of his great power great responsibility you can t call out spiderman for that without calling out all of spiderman comics or superhero comics on the whole it works in universe,0
mark you gotta review some spider man comic runs now you have to,0
one of your best mark love the analysis and would love you to look at more super hero genre films going forward,0
i m so glad someone else shares my feelings on spider man,0
oh boy mark i wonder what you think of the andrew garfield movies,1
hi long time fan his mask is part of the superhero trope spiderman himself spidey as a superhero is larger than life to the citizens they are unaware of what he is many thinking he is an alien an adult a humanoid spider they even said this in the movies unique to spiderman the humanistic part of the character comes from peter parker that s why peter is a main part of the ethos as opposed to maybe batman it works beautifully and is expressed in spiderman in the train scene when his mask comes off and the citizens realise he is a kid and rallies behind him the mask works it s part of spiderman it s built into the character his unmasking is a big deal ala civil war one more day back in black it is very important edit the climax of spiderman was as moving as it was because his face was covered for the majority of the movie had he been expressive throughout the movie it wouldn t have been as powerful he has been hurt thought the movie to see that expression all the time wouldn t have made this scene so powerful it s the first time u saw the hero in trouble and u could relate to it,1
you re usually on the nose but other times you re just grasping at straws to find every little meaning nitpick about something the mask thing is a perfect example,1
easy answer to the train fight question spiderman never learned how to throw a punch,1
tobey maguire to me was the perfect peter parker who captures the nerdy and awkward side of the character sadly as spider man he does do much of the wise cracking jokes like spider man does to throw bad guys off their game he does make jokes but not much if you want to see tobey being fully spider man is mostly in his video games,1
great video did you notice that your sound recording has some interference it s noticeable among others around the mark just to let you know it didn t distract from the enjoyment of watching your work,0
everyone else talking about the spider man me you re thirty,0
does this mean mark is gonna start reviewing spider man comics alongside manga please,1
i will say i enjoy the video so far but the audio being muted when characters are talking to be replaced with some faint music is a little jarring i understand why this was done because copyright issues but it just feels so weird,0
there are explanations theories for why peter can lift so much and his punches do so little either a in this movie he was so stressed and scared that he couldn t control his powers sometimes even losing them maybe he was so scared that he could accidentally kill otto while trying to knock him out because he doesn t know his own strength and how much power he needs to put in a punch or b lifting power and punching power are separate but both do compliment each other lifting a lot is not the same as punching hard if superman can lift a planet it doesn t mean that one punch from him could destroy it immediately,0
this was masterful brought me to tears at one point and made me feeeeel like spider man but mark no reference to video game dunkeys spider man review no mention of big wheel,1
the aunt may part pf this video made ke tear up a bit i m late but even i needed this speech,0
this is a problem with spider man in general even in the comic books he s too strong he should be able to kill a person with a single punch but this would make things too easy for him so the writers have to do this i always notice that in spider man stories,0
triple rent mr dirkavitch,0
oh yeah in regards to spiderman pulling his punches there is a reference to it in superior spiderman comics not sure if it s that one where doc oc realizes just how strong peter is and says something a long the lines this kid could have killed me at any time without any trouble and decided not to,0
eagerly saw number when it came out tobey maguire s bad boy persona is about of the reason i don t like the movie it s still astounding that they couldn t see how awful it was,0
dam had to hold back my tears in this video essay,0
mark every video believe it or not but this is the reason i m alive today,0
mark i have to say i fucking love you i utterly agree that the best quality of the human race is the capacity for to do good great job to you and everyone involved in making this video,0
the irony in harry s death is that despite doing the right thing in the end he died the same way is father did,0
yo is that phil lamar on the right there,0
one thing i didn t like from sam raimi s first spider man movie that seems outdated or unrealistic is that peter parker before he got his powers received no help from teachers the bus driver at the beginning would ve got fired and that intimidating teacher as well that who scenario reminds me of arthur pendragon from shrek the third,0
a very heartfelt and interesting review one of the best you ve done thank you for it i needed this video too keep safe everyone and keep strong,0
i appreciate the ultimate alliance theme music at the beginning,0
thank god somebody finally understands mj in the raimi films,0
you know i m somewhat of a responsibility myself,1
you made the difference in my day man i m always loocking forward to your videos well done,0
spiderman pulls his punches because if he really tried he would just instakill everyone he fought which is very much against his values when doc ock took over his body in the superior spiderman comics he took off scorpion s jaw in one blow with a punch now if he got actually worked up and angry he would be punching peoples limbs and heads off,0
an hour long video and not a minute wasted this might be one of the most well done analysis of the spider man trilogy i ve ever seen,0
i believe with the nitpick that peter holds back due to his trauma with uncle ben and his killer how he didn t hold back and killed him becoming the killers equal if he were to go all out he would become the same bullet that killed his uncle ben,0
mark has strayed far from his dbz path it s probably because there s nothing else to talk about because the content in that fandom ran dry he has a lust for a never ending journey makes sense why his profile picture is still one piece,0
andrew garfield least favourite man what a trash take these fans got,0
mans really got me crying in a spider man review like how,0
spiderman does more actual heroics in the first movie than everyone in the mcu has done combined,0
the mandelorian proved you can get so much emotion out of a mask you just have to do it properly,0
great video,0
i live for the commercials mark makes there always so funny and creative,0
i almost cried watching this video no cap,1
your not getting this rent until you fix this damn door,0
spider man is my favorite also you make it seem like mary jane didn t do anything wrong in spider man,0
best ad spot ever buying gfuel tonight,0
great movies amazing trilogy strong positive message there is something for everybody for all ages,1
meme of you defending spider man lol,0
scott the woz is best peter parker,0
i wow this is the best video of,0
can t wait for the next one,0
masterful,0
lmfao that ad,0
wow just wow i went through a whole therapy session with u mark thnx for the content and for the effort put into this min video never give up on what u love and i hope ur doing okay just wow inspirational bro,0
i haven t rewatched spiderman sight it first came out and i personally thought it was good but not better than the other but i couldn t understand why did i still enjoy that movie but when watching this video all the way through it finally clink and make me love all movies so much more great video can t wait to watch more,0
something that i just realized that will suck so badly on nwh is the waste of green goblin s potential i m sure he will be a cool character and all but one of if not the best thing that s the mcu spidey has going for him is the ability to naturally portray progression and flow of stories we know the mcu universe we know characters from early movies can heavily impact on other characters or in later movies of that same one that said imagine how absolutely cool it would ve been to introduce normal osborn in homecoming or even show peter interacting with harry and normal in the end credits of civil war and then show normal as one supporting force in ffh even appearing for a few minutes from time to time to check on peter and be that figure in his life all of this to culminate in nwh and further maybe when norman properly betrays him and we have that impactful moment we do have a great thing with iron man and spidey s relationship although that too was unfortunately underdeveloped hell one of the things that i was more excited for ffh after watching endgame was seeing peter be an older brother of sorts to tony s daughter literally just open the movie with him playing with her and saying goodbye to pepper on a minute long scene in short the mcu is not using it s biggest strength on its biggest character properly and that s just sad,1
i m a big fan of james franco totally not mark ummm should i tell him or do one of you guys want to,0
the more these g fuel promos go on the less i feel like i know about what the actual product is,0
let s not forget japanese spider man,0
i actually have an argument for why spiderman couldn t knock doc ock out and opted to wear him down imagine if i ask you to knock out a newborn baby you aren t allowed to kill it give it any severe life altering injuries you can t just crack its soft skull or give it a brain bleed unless you have incredible dexterity and control chances are you are going to low ball your hit and just tap it i think a similar thing is happening here peter doesn t want to just take doc s head clean off but he is also so much stronger and more durable than doc that it s almost impossible for him to deliver the exact amount of force the line between knocking someone out and killing them outright is not that big especially if you can punch through concrete his only option at that point is to love tap him and hope that he goes down eventually,0
this video was amazing,0
great review made me cry more than once would love for you to do a review of the dark knight trilogy since it s my favorite superhero movies alongside raimi s spiderman,0
now i m even more hyped for the new spidey film,0
that has to be the best gfuel ad i ve ever seen,0
omg its the spider guy from the new fortnite season,0
i can t believe you integrated modiji in the video mark you ve done it again surpassing everyone s expectations and delivering another banger hats off to ya,0
tom holland is my favorite spiderman,0
my right ear appreciate that by my left one is sad,0
your g fuel ad made me gay x,0
dude you gotta review the spectacular spider man cartoon show man that had so much heart in it,0
that ad tho,0
we all know the best absolute spiderman is john jonah jameson junior,1
i never actually watched the spiderman movies as a kid but just the few scenes i catches made me fall in love with spider man and to this day he s still my favorite superhero to ever exist,0
there is a major strength lacking in the third film and it s related to harry throughout the first two films harry is trying to make his father proud when realizing peter is spiderman he makes the change to seek revenge even if upon figuring out norman was the green goblin at the end of the second film he could potentially see that it wasn t just a murder harry can still feel betrayed that it was peter s battles with norman which resulted in the latter s death ultimately it should have been harry s decision to come to peter s aid not with any influence that his father died from being impaled by his own glider conveyed to him to possibly the worst butler in the history of cinema in the end it should have been harry s rejection of norman s influence and embracing peter s influence through ben which caused him to do what was right,1
quite a beautiful video mark sam raimi s spider man trilogy is my earliest memory of spider man and i m pretty sure my introduction as a kid i was mainly interested in the action scenes and were my favorite parts of the movies today i still love the action scenes but also love the human dialogue moments just as much as i get older i relate to peter s struggles and his imperfections the villains are so interesting the themes are so adult and honest the music is spectacular and can t forget the legendary memes also the complete passion that went into these movies was just unbelievable and i m so glad i grew up with these movies the mcu is great and i love it but none of those movies will ever top the raimi trilogy and i doubt we will ever get something like them again the trilogy that truly showed why spider man is the greatest superhero in all of fiction,1
awesome video as always always love your take on animes and now spiderman,0
hey what anime manga do you think your gonna review next mark if you dont know please do chainsawman,0
i haven t seen anyone mentioning this so just in case someone doesn t knows raimi said the reason bruce campbell seems to be bouncing from job to job between the movies is that raimi was planning on using him as mysterio on the fourth movie that sony cancelled those little interactions with peter would serve as a background for how they met and how mysterio operates,1
what the actual fuck that g fuel had no business being that good,0
spiderman is my fav superhero movie ever,0
yooooo check out my sam raimi trilogy review brah,0
cant wait for his take on the amazing spiderman,0
spider man is everyone s favourite film in the trilogy me sweats and looks away,0
the ps ost is really throwing me off,0
i m honestly without words you ve said all there is to it in a truly fantastic and powerful way i still look up to this trilogy as the first entry i had to super heroes and with every character i write about i use this trilogy to help me understand what truly makes a good hero fantastic video,1
tobey is my spiderman,0
whatever you said felt like you re me,0
mark the raimi suit is stiff and emotionless me oh no anyway this has never occurred to me until this video and i get it i d even agree that it s stiff it has never bothered me tho maybe now it will now that i m aware of it and i won t be able to ignore it in which case i ll know who to blame for ruining these movies for me d,1
if anyone someday had a doubt yes she knows even though the scene and great acting makes it clear in the spider man comic adaptation right after her speech shows peter walking away and thinking she knows she definitely knows every aunt may no matter the universe knows that her nephew everyday save people s lives and live with the fear of someday he won t make it home but she respects it and she s never going to try and stop him because it s what her husband would want,0
bro you should do the same kind of video for the spectacular spider man,0
but have you read sam raimi s interview with araki they did for the japanese playboy when spiderman came out,0
you while everyone can enjoy this review of the sam raimi and see them as pure entertainment they truly do carry an important message i m so thankful that you touched on that mark and if nothing else i appreciate you for opening up about those struggles you were experiencing during these last unprecedented years keep doing your thing man and if nothing else always keep being the amazing reviewer you are much love and support man,1
commenting for the algorithm i really like a non anime movie review from you hope this blows up,0
my biggest problem with the rami trilogy is tobey himself when i was a kid i enjoyed the films for what they where and being a big spiderman fan as i was i was just happy to have them exist i still not fond of tobey potrayal as spiderman becos there wasnt a difference between spiderman and peter spidey wasnt the cocky wise cracking hero i loved when he puts the mask on he felt like a new person he cud be someone he wasnt in real life i feel the third film should of either leaned into venom more or got rid entirly venom and suits battle cud of been the message power corrupts absoulty as peter at the start of the film is being swallowed by sed power and admiration he is getting that he never had before sry i felt like sayin that even tho its probably a hot take and no one will read it,0
while i do agree with most of what you have said one of the parts where i disagree with is the aunt may scenes even when i was kid and i saw them i always felt that they were wrong i do understand that its possible that she never learned of his secret identity but peter tried to open up to her several times and in all the times that he did she kind of spat in his face i know that in most of their interactions in the end she did provide helpful advice but that was only after she said or did something that hurt him and made him reluctant to open up to anyone else i really wish that maybe at the end of the rd movie or if the th movie had ever gotten made that he finally confessed everything to aunt may just so that they could fully resolve the things that they had between them since she possibly though of him as cowardly scum for abandoning her at the bank and for getting ben killed for selfish reasons when the reality was that he had other things going on,1
i felt the television part on a deep level i lost my grandma in eerily similar circumstances in late april,0
sam rami didn t understand venom and that s not his fault for him getting put in but it did hurt the film,0
was that lucy lawless good work mark i had no clue about all the narrative themes parallels and contrasts in these movies and your analysis really shone a light on them making me appreciate them a lot more cheers,0
this made me smile nice going mark,0
despite the fact that spider man weren t actually good movies they are sooooooo enjoyable nothing can take that away,1
i feel one of the reasons spider man wasn t as good is cause sam raimi made a so amazing job on spider man that it was hard to top spider man and of course avi arad trying to push venom when raimi told him he didn t want to do it cause he doesn t understand venom and then guilt trippin him you used the villains you wanted now give the fans what they want they want venom instead of a good story he wanted to sell toys cause that s what he is a toy seller not a movie writer and of course sony interference,0
those commercial breaks are probably the best i have ever seen,0
mark mind if you review s spider man the animated series and s spectacular spider man,0
why do i want to give u my money,0
while i do agree that peter as spider man does help a lot of people i also believe that peter with his high intelligence could have helped just as many people if not more in an indirect way it s all about what he chooses to do with his life and he chose to be a hero in the form of spider man nothing wrong with that i m just saying there are other ways to be a hero ways that don t need a costume or superpowers,0
my dad a huge spider man fan hates spider man for reasons doc ocks face should ve exploded and peter takes his mask off during the train fight and he hates the whole movie for it,0
spider man was great except for venom it could ve venom plot end as a post credit scene when eddie gets the symbiote and just have more sandman instead,0
that g fuel ad tho epic and now im thirsty for g fuel,0
i wouldn t trade these movies for the world but i m so curious what the fincher movie would look like cuz it sounds dope,0
to me spider man represents a hero trying to do what s right a hero we all strive to be more like everyday,0
am i the only one who likes the rd one,0
loved this video great work as always can you please please make one on the captain america trilogy too i d love to see your take on that,0
i can accept that some people dont like these movies but no one can say that the score is bad its so good,0
you finally outdid yourself,0
before i watch this video toby s trilogy gets better every year,0
dam bro i m disliking everything cuz of youtube but i couldn t dislike this,0
what about that old other spiderman movie the we don t talk about,0
where s the berserk vid,0
half an hour into this video as i m shopping at target i start crying my eyes out so i would like to lodge a complaint but also deep deep respect and thanks,0
bruh ima cry,0
i wonder how you feel about the editors cut where they change the butler scene,0
deep thanks,0
isn t that side the side where he gets burned foreshadowing,0
a lot of the shots on the train fight show that dock ock has at least of his arms gripped to the train those arems are super powerful and i d argue that they re just as strong if not more strong than spidey s punches so i feel that peter s punches wouldn t send him flying back then again this is one of those minor nitpicky things and i mean no disresepct or hate towards you mark sandman actually became a favorite villain of mine because of spider man and i was actually super bummed when i found out he s more or less portrayed as a generic thug type villain in a lot of other spider man media this is a great video keep up the wonderful work,0
sir you teach me so many words in an enjoyable manner also i aspire to critically analyze mediums of entertainment manga movies etc to a level close to you,0
another banger review mark keep up the good work also wow wasn t expecting the end credits theme to the spider man game always loved that theme,0
hop sad now,0
one thing i didn t like was that sandman was retconned as being part of the robbery that killed ben two things i hate in writing retcons and small worlding,0
in everybody hated the funky soul dance scene in everybody loves it because we weren t intelligent enough to see it s greatness,0
amazing job this video had me hooked for the whole hour run time i vibe with the spidey love and can t wait to see what you put out next,1
i was watching this and i got to mark s explanation over stuff that happened to him in right when he got to how he started to worry about his own death in the future two things happened first my brain immediately reminded me that i did the same thing during i was just as scared about the idea of my own mortality despite being a teenager who really shouldn t be focused on that stuff then immediately after that thought flashed into my mind my bible app sent a notification for a verse of the day cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you peter and i just thought the timing of that couldn t have been more perfect as it was practically a response to all of that,0
andrew in asm was a pretty good sm at times just stuck in the worst movie ever like wtf just watched it it is balls to the wall nonsense,0
personally i like those movies more than the other spiderman movies but tobey s is the worst characterization of spiderman still good movies though,0
mark the aunt may speech was something you brought to light to me i saw it as a big turning point for spider man which gave him the answer to save the day in the end of the nd movie but i cried with your story and what that aunt may speech truly means and now she is my favorite character out of this trilogy thank you love you vids keep the good work,0
i really dont get why everyone hated the dancing scene to the point they hate the whole movie,0
i ve been rewatching all the spider man films in prep for no way home and after finishing far from home to me the ramie trilogy still captures the struggle of peter parker and the world of the comics making it feel real and tangible unlike the cgi heavy tasm and mcu spider man films i prefer andrew in the role as i believe he captures the best charisma as peter and spider man unlike tobey who can be quiet monotone a lot of the time and a bit bland and tom is fine but the script is really holding him back overshadowing him with comedy and not giving him real consequences hopefully reconciled in no way home but for me tobeys trilogy really still captures the world of spider man in the best way to this day and feels the most realistic even if it is goofy and very comic like,0
i see what you mean with the mask still think it is minor but it could ve added a lot i think raimi realized this which is why the majority of the critical scenes involved spiderman without his mask or his mask half torn also really liked you sharing the impact this aunt may had on you based on your experience,0
i think a good part of the hate toward sm comes from the time between ut and sm it s far from a perfect movie it has many flaws that the two managed to avoid and i think it s normal that it didn t get all the praises the others got but still when you watch the trilogy back to back everything just works a lot of the things that people felt where off character and didn t make sense actually totally work with what came before like you said the forst one was about accepting responsibility the second movie is about living with it and the third is about what everything that comes with it does to you at this point peter s ego as grown disproportionately nd is further emplified by venom he s disconnected not only from the people he cares about but also from what made him who he was to put it simply it all got his head when you ve been waiting years for the next installment chances are the details and exact development of things can get a little foggy but for this movie to work you basically need to watch the previous ones for it to make sense it s a natural progression that doesn t feel natural if you don t pay attention to it,1
ok so we just skipping berserk review,0
don t worry mark on the internet spiderman is king,0
enough said,0
that g fuel ad was so well done i was looking for the skip ad button but is that your voice do you lower it down for the narration or pitch it up for the commercials,0
i love this review you offered a fresh perspective on sp and made me realise how underrated sp was i agree on so many points and i love thr g fuel ad just won t age well xd,1
i m watching this for christmas,1
harry is legitimately my favorite character in this trilogy,1
you know i m something of a green goblin myself,0
are you influencing yet son,0
good job mark lovin it looking forward to andrews series if you re doing it,1
one thing i gotta say that maybe you didn t know is the novelization of spider man shows how the tentacles had voices and you see what they said and what they twisted ock to do like an evil conscience it offered a whole new perspective and i read it on a whim for a book report as a kid also your reviews prove again how tobey was a great parker but i still feel andrew was a better spider man and tom is the best of both as for the if he can pull back a train he should be able to knock out ock in punch i d say read the comic superior spider man fantastic story when ock takes over peter s body he immediately realizes how much he mentally and physically holds back against actual people it s not just pulling punches i also agree with your end statement spider man has and always will be my favorite superhero this makes me wanna rewatch the movies even another issue with eddie brock was the character was done completely wrong he wasn t a skinny teen he was a middle age body builder with long ties to the bugle,0
that ad gave me goosebumps lol well done,0
this is a great i actually loved all three movies and all the versions of spider man and the actors you could really tell they enjoyed it there is some problems in the third movie one thing that still bothers me is how the whole plot point of gwen and eddie actually dating being completely forgotten but sam raimi and the actors still did an incredible job i remember watching the behind the scenes and seeing all the fun they were having in the background and how much the other actors got the films were having to in interviews and footage can t wait to see you cover the other two spider man s,0
through my whole list of favorite movies there are only two that i can say for sure are and will forever be my all time favorites willy wonka the chocolate factory and spider man i love these films so pathologically much that i somewhat have a distaste for the new versions a distaste that sometimes can t even be really justified not charlie and the chocolate factory that movie is an insult and i hate it with every fiber of my body but spider man is one of the very few superhero films that i not only consider a genuinely spectacular movie but that no matter how many times i rewatch it never loses its magic it s one of those movies that i only grow to love more everytime i watch it doesn t rely on the original works cheap gags or its fanbase to be just another suprehero movie that will make a ton of money and i will forget in a day or two you can see the love that was poured into making these movies they are honest with themselves and the fans,1
mark describing this version of aunt may as kind and sincere while showing a clip of her beating doc oc with a wrench is hilarious not that i m discrediting his point but the choice of clip is just funny,1
its not a controversial take to say rosemary harris was one of the best performances but its controversial to not include j k simmons among the best performances,0
one of your best videos mark thanks for the content you deserve every bit of recognition you get didn t know i needed that aunt may speech either until today,0
my favorite spider man is actually josh keaton from spectacular spider man the show is painfully underrated which i get the art style isn t going to wow anyone but the writing is the best it s ever been though andrew garfield i d put at though he appeared in arguably the worst films and wasn t always written the best but i thought andrew s performance and that incarnation s interest in science really did a lot for me tobey takes rd he felt like he captured high school aged peter parker better than anyone but i didn t feel like he captured the interest in science or spider man s quips he does benefit a lot from being in the single best spider man movie though we didn t get quite as much time with them both peter parker s in into the spider verse were good representations of spider man tom holland only the only hand has been in three well written films only one of which he was the main character of but i don t feel like he exemplifies any aspect of the character he s just kinda okay,0
your complaint with the mask is unfair peter parker is separate from spider man peter parker is the one with the emotion spider man is not so it makes sense we can t see spider man mouth move it s kind of like all might always smiling being pillar of hope and the symbol of peace spider man can t be the symbol of hope if his mouth is agape in horror or fear,0
an explanation for the apparent plot hole that peter should be able to knock out doc ock with one punch is otto s spinal implant since the implant goes all the way up otto s spine it could protect him against whiplash not only that but if the arms are doing some of the work then they could use that spine to make otto roll with the punches so that none of spider man s hits ever land full force in the most extreme example even if otto does get knocked out the arms could just puppet his body they can operate whether or not otto is awake and since they are connected directly into his nervous system the arms could theoretically even control otto s body while he s unconscious the hospital scene also implies that the arms have the ability to wake him up too so the whole doc ock should be beat with one punch argument doesn t hold any water as a matter of fact the only times doc ock is ever defeated is when the arms themselves are directly damaged,1
i see marks been watching osw s ultimate warrior videos for his g fuel conercial this time around,0
man that background music makes me really want you to do a review of the ps spiderman story easily my fav spidey,0
man i gotta say after finding your videos back when you did your vegeta anti hero video was made me have a bigger appreciation for writing and show movies i often overlooked like the small stuff this review was pretty much brought up the points i mentioned to my friends watching a lot of your work and the books you talked about with writing have actually made me want to write anyway i look forward to the next videos,0
the best one yes,0
andrew garfield is my favorite spider man,1
tobey is my personal favorite spiderman the trilogy is great i love the suits characters etc even the bad movie has really enjoyable moments and good character development i have nothing against the garfield or holland performances both are great as well but i enjoy the dorky peter parker tobey brought to the table more,1
i m literally crying wth this was supposed to be fun,0
bro mark this video brought me to tears sam ramey s spider man has always been my favorite and brought light into my life when i needed it most and you brought it back that light i used to feel as a kid pretending to be spider man this video format and choice touched my heart and i just wanted to thank you and everyone who was apart of its production,0
hey mark i know you mainly do anime manga and the like but i was wondering if you ll do a review of the narrative of the devil may cry series the series of games goes from in chronological order because i have a feeling someone will ask that question at some point,0
wow,0
hats off to you tnm this review was really just amazing this almost one hour of a review video was worth all that time i really love your reviews man keep it up you re one of my favourite youtubers and this review really proves why i really loved when you put that part where you told us about loosing your grandmother to cancer and about your father getting sick it made me emotional and sad thank you for this review man you made a lot of great points in this and the final message of the trilogy was just amazing you really captured what the movies themes and messages were you made me realize this as well thanks a bunch and i can t wait for the next spider man review,0
man minutes in and i ve been consistently crying shedding tears you really put into words things i ve been thinking about this movie for years man and everything struck a a chord with me,0
gotta say i love the touch of john paesano s spider man score in the background,0
you guys can think whatever you want but i believe that yuri lowenthal s spidey in the ps games is one of the greatest variations of the character ever he can simultaneously portray the awkward yet good natured nerdy kid from queens and the confident and experienced hero at the drop of hat he designs all his own tech has had plenty of time to move past the awkward growing pains of learning about his powers and can routinely fight off mobs of crooks supervillains and enhanced mercenaries without breaking a sweat he can also quip like no ones business,0
well sorry to the voters but holland is then best spider then tobey and i love the first trilogy that was my childhood,1
this is amazing,0
thank you,0
agree with a lot of this review great job as always mark ps love the usage of mvc music,1
i loved this review of yours mark but i felt your time where you talked about your personal life i had lost my best friend this year because i d fight against his depression i had lost someone very important in my life and never got to say goodbye,0
okay i know most people are gonna comment on how good the video was as well as their own thoughts and opinions but is it just me who cried at mark s story i know it wasn t the focus but i think just the way he explained what he was going through it s kinda what i ll remember this review for and how it made me connect with mark keep staying strong dude,1
i ve tried so hard to like the og rami trilogy i just can t the main hurdles for me is the acting and chemistry between the two main characters i find tobey s acting to be quite terrible and anytime he s on screen with kirsten dundsts i roll my eyes due to them having no romantic chemistry the best parts about the first are the villains and jj but aside from that i just can t connect with this version of peter mj and harry,0
i remember being like and making my parents bring me to this movie times in a row lmao,0
i don t like the andrew garfield movies but i think he was the best spider man,1
why are the movie clips so quiet,1
why hasn t nebula reached out to partner with you so you can talk about media analysis,0
i m sad we won t be seeing naruto this month but i m uncontrollably happy were getting this i love the toby mcguire movies personally,0
got a little choked up around the mark kudos man,0
wonderful analysis bro,0
my head cannon for the reason that he couldn t knock out doc ock during that fight scene is that he doesn t have that much control of his strength he hasn t been spider man for too long in spider man and i feel like it was an all or nothing type situation,0
all was good till u said my last name wrong lol mole e na lolol love that u say names differently,0
jonah not giving peter up to gobby,0
you kidding man tobeys suit sucks because he can t see his expressions,0
peter made a deez nuts joke b it was popular,0
does he shoot at opps,0
holy crap that section about your family and having to deal with the sudden realization of your own mortality really hit me i actually recently had a week long panic episode all about well the mortality of everything my cat my wife my parents just the fact that nothing in life is ever permanent until you yourself are no longer around to make new bonds that you have to struggle to hold on to i actually cried through your whole section about this struggle for you and how this movie helped i m better now but it s still something that frightens me from time to time i think i will have to revisit some of my favorite childhood movies to see if they have more scenes like this one that might help me now that i m an adult as well,0
superman is the man of tomorrow and spider man is the man of today,0
im not gonna cry when i hear the music im not gonna cry when i hear the music music starts aaaaahhhhhh cries,0
alex ross is such a god like artist,0
i gotta say while spidey didnt have that good of a venom what caught my interest in him was the ultimate spider man comics and game which were some of my st run ins with the character i liked his dichotomy with spidey while peter found a way to get over his parents death accepting it eddie was old enough to where those scars still stuck with him peter recognized the dangers of the suit eddie took all of it and when he found out peter trashed their parents lifes work he hated him for it in the comics i like how eddie stops hurting others as he views them as innocents and only goes after peter hes grown so much in the recent comics run too becoming a caring father that looks up to peter and agent venom while trying to do better for his son,1
i think that mark is starting to have a bit too much fun with these ads,0
i think the reason why the original tobey movies are so good to me personally is that they felt more true to the character of spider man than the later movies tobey is an absolute dorky looking dude as peter he has the same awkward delivery on his one liners that seems consistent with a geeky kid who just randomly became a superhero on accident and it just seemed so consistent to me with how spider man was portrayed in other media like video games and comics,0
i would have to make an equally thought out and eloquent video just to express how this one video has touched me not just as a fellow spider man fan but also as a human being i can feel your heart in this and i loved every second i literally cried during the spider man segment so good man i could go on but for now i ll just say this to me this is the best video you ve made so far you just keep improving with all the content you produce and i am truly honored humbled and uplifted to see your growth and to enjoy the quality of your content i cannot wait to see how far we climb from here and just know i am strapped in for the ride to the end of the line thank you,1
when that gfuel ad started i thought i had forgotten even more scenes from these spiderman films great job man wow your reviews are always so thorough and points so well explained,1
absolutely perfect video,0
amazing review mark sam raimi s spider man trilogy will always gonna be my favorite spidey film,0
imma be the odd out but tasm is my nd favorite spidey movie along with spidey the st being into the spider verse,0
amazing mark as always,0
i like these movies but i gotta say mj is pretty garbage in these movies,0
the reason doc oc isn t knocked out by peter s punches is because the arms are keeping him from feeling the effects they re in his brain messing with the chemicals so he s not feeling the pain that s why in the comics later in life doc is jacked up on his deathbed from all the fights regardless of feeling fine at the time,0
one thing is the symbiote didn t make peter an egotistical asshole he was already heading down that route it just enhanced those emotions that he already had at the time,1
can t wait for the next review,0
can i just say that when goblin pulled up on may i feel it was to pay her ass back for that hand slap it being peters aunt was just the icing on the cake,0
an issue with ur opinion on the mask i think his mask fitting him that tightly would be a problem u arent supoosed to see what he s like emoting under the mask instead u tell from the emotion carried in the tone of voice and body language not including the face i feel that while the eyes moving and mask being that tight would be cool its not necessary to understand the emotion of the character,0
i always use superior spider man comic as the argument for peter holding back his punches there s otto literally punching scorpion s jaw off the example people use the most but like a throughout the comic whenever he gets mad and starts throwing punches with reckless abandon people are left broken,0
phenomenal review spider man is truly one of the greatest characters of all time the raimi trilogy made me fall in love with the character and his mythos can t wait to see the garfield and holland reviews respectively p s it d be great if they came out before no way home lmao,0
ugh alex ross is terrible don t use him as n example for what you think it should be based on,0
mary chain and might may are literally the worst fucking characters in the trilogy,0
no i still hate all of these movies for the simple fact that tobey was a terrible choice my opinions are unpopular but that s because everybody else is wrong last part was pure hyperbole don t hate me cause i m beautiful,0
which version of the raimi suit do you prefer while i love the shape of the head and the front logo of the suit the suit is just superior to me especially regarding the back logo and larger lenses,0
i ve always wondered do you all think that aunt may knew that peter was spiderman during the hero in all of us scene i totally agree with marc it s my favorite scene too,0
tom voice in the ad man i missed him hahaha,0
spiderverse is the best spiderman movie ever made,0
imo spider man is the best spider man movie of all time,0
mark this feels stupid writing in the comment section but i don t know how else to reach you regarding what you said about your grandmother and father in i went and am still going through the exact same thing on febuary th we found out my dad s cancer had metastasized to his bones after years of him being in the clear before i could react the lockdowns hit and i was living alone grossly abusing tobacco and alcohol for close to months until i was hospitalized once i quit alcohol i started having panic attacks and a fear of death i had never experienced before i couldn t sleep for close to a year and medication kept me sane but didn t make me well i don t know what helped you but for me doing the wim hof method since august has helped me so so much i feel free of anxiety and feel like a can withstand anything life throws at me the only reason i m writing this is because i have no idea were you are on your healing journey but i know that this is what helped me stay strong and get well brother,0
i m not going to lie i thought the gfuel ad was an actual commercial,1
spoder,0
one day please review the venoms they aren t masterpieces but i love them so i would love to see your thoughts,0
i haven t teared up for a youtube video for years let alone the fact that i did twice for this vid,1
it took me a few days to watch the entire video amazing work pun intended so i apologize this comment is so late i believe you should do the ditko lee run of amazing at some point in the future the podcast screw it we re just gonna talk about spider man did the run a few years ago which made me re read the run myself and it s a masterpiece that still holds up today your insight would make me want to re read it once again,0
spider man is my favorite,0
this was honestly really cool to watch and listen to i m glad that there are other people who value the character and journey of peter parker the best part of any of the videos you make is probably your understanding of the character s journey qualities and faults and i don t think that it s ever been more evident than it is here thanks for making this it was a reminder of what makes spidey the best keep going mark,0
thanks for making another video i will probably watch more times as i loved these movies as a kid to and seeing you review and talk about them reminded me of why i also love spider man and why he s my favorite hero though for me the thing i loved about him was his determination the fact that even if he staggered and was pushed to his limits by his villains he would always continue to struggle and fight because the time he doesn t is when another tragedy like happened to his uncle ben happens again tried to fit the other half to but youtube wouldn t let me,0
one of the things that always bugged me about the venom in this movie was that he felt to small to me venom was this massive imposing tank that was essentially a stronger and more monstrous spider man but watching this video and hearing you talk about the themes of the rd movie it clicked to me that raimi made venom small though it was probably a way to make venom easier to cgi to personify that darkness in peter peter is literally fighting a monstrous dark shadow of himself,0
i hope you pay your editor well because he never disappoints,0
yesss i love your dragon ball reviews and was disappointed with most of the spider man reviews i ve seen because of the standards you ve built please review the amazing spider man series and keep up the great work,0
like you never watched these since was a kid and i never really enjoyed them as spider man films besides the nd one but watching you review them from story point of view man i might have to gives these a rewatch kudos you always make me enjoy medium i already consumed even more by just listening to your representation of them and things i missed or chose to look over,0
my favorite thing about the ending with otto is the line brilliant but lazy otto looked at peter when they first met as a young man with amazing potential and wasting it by not using the intelligence that he has after everything in the movie leading up to that point the moment peter takes his mask off he almost immediately eats all of his words from their initial interaction the boy he thought was wasting his potential was living up to it and using his gift for the good of mankind for years even if it meant sacrificing his personal life to do so,1
old school aunt may really was the best one all hail rosemary harris she s still alive and i hope she has a cameo in no way home,0
if he doesn t show the clip with joey diaz i m unsubbing,0
is no one gonna talk about that ad that shit was a trailer also made me thirsty,0
i completely disagree about the mask i never noticed it every thing came across to me without seeing his face expression,0
the whole how strong is peter bit in the second movie can be explain by the difference between lifting strength and striking strength just cause you can let very heavy objects doesn t automatically mean your punches can do the same thing,1
this video took the words out of my mouth and left me breathless at the same time like idk what to add or say other than you did tobey justice and everything the movies stood for and just so much more glad to have just subscribed can t wait to see the other two spider man s if you do them,0
you might want to get your microphone checked out i heard a bit of buzzing a few times in the video,0
bruhhhh i watched the whole video without pausing once great job mark,0
the new spiderman movie is coming out on my birthday d,0
its crazy that i can relate to you my dad died in and it really messed up not as bad at first but as i hit my s i realized im actually afraid to die and was also considering therapy as well cuz i do have alot of panic attacks but i hope your journey gets easier,0
man i really hope they don t just turn oc and osborne into generic big bad in the new movie in the trailer it already feels like there s too much going on four villain s with no history together a time dimensional travel plot line a second hero character who traditionally doesn t pair up with spidey and the sub plot of being framed for murder,0
sam raimi should watch this and post his reaction,0
you missed one important part in the fire scene after he saves the girl the firefighters say someone was still in the building and they didn t survive this scene shows he can t save everyone,0
i love andrew garfield spider man i wish more people liked it,0
although im not an american a lot of the us culture was brought to me country and that includes whatever movies and shows were on there including all the hero movies yet i never really connected to these american heroes even from young age i was much more into dbz and anime even if i didn t know what anime was back then i guess it s mostly because the american heroes felt much more flat and un inspiring but also way less cool so they really had no edge at all over anime characters,0
a lot of people have probably said this but the punching doc ock could be explained as psychological lock he s not trying to hold back as much as he has to do it humans in general there are exceptions of course don t kill other humans unless trained to do so or in extreme emotion especially a guy as wracked with guilt as peter is his power level is not that dissimilat to the hulk he just can t do that while fighting someone unless he couldn t think anymore,0
this video is amazing man,0
ngl it feels like i m the only one who likes andrew and especially the first amazing spider man film,0
for me all these movies felt like one big move back to back to back i always loved the experience of watching these movies and as everyone i watched these movies for like times,0
they should have kept venon for the next movie and only introduce eddie brock and the black suit in the rd,0
i have always loved spider man and a large part of that is because of the sam rami trilogy i think you did an excellent deconstruction of them to talk about what makes them so compelling so lovable and so important to people of our generation i also appreciate that the outro music you used was a music track from the video game adaptation of the first raimi movie i dig small fanservice y things like that,0
from reviewing japanese anime and manga to american comic books what a change,1
spider man pulling his punches is addressed in the comics he should be able to knock many of these guys out in one hit but it s a fine line between knocking them out and accidentally killing them there s a scene where someone gets peter s powers and goes to hit someone without realizing the sheer strength spider man has and takes their jaw off their face entirely,1
these movies bring so many feels,0
i don t think i ve watch the mcguire spider man movies in over a decade but just seeing the scene of the train crowd pulling a mask less peter through the train especially after all he s went through made me tear up a little bit he s giving all of himself to save these people and they raise him up and protect him when he s defenseless even protecting his identity in thanks of his sacrifice it s perfect,0

i know what i heard spiderman for ps playing in the background nice,0
words cannot express how good of a take you have done on this mark bravo,0
tom,0
hearing all this again reminds us how much we loved and missed these movies they were fun meaningful and inspiring as a kid they got us into reading spider man comics and collect the figures we still cherish to this day hearing you review this reminded me all over again of how much fun it was and is watching these movies,1
try and review the show spectacular spiderman is the best adaptation,0
this was such a great review thank you mark for your efforts on it and the efforts of those who helped make this happen i really loved watching it,0
i just have a problem with the tobey movie people ignore the bad stuff specially qith the first one i doesn t look as good as the other movies it isnt as well written as spiderman nor as funny as spiderman,0
absolutely love the video i agree with pretty much everything you said the nitpick that you make about spiderman s strength is a thing that gets covered in the comics where it i stated that he holds back a tremendous amount so that one he doesn t kill the opponent and that he holds back so much because calculating the amount of strength he should use becomes harder and more risky the closer he gets to knocking them out in one punch this is why when in the superior spiderman series when doc oc takes over peter s body he accidentally knocks off scorpion s jaw,1
there was never a spider man movie before the raimi ones lol,0
why did that g fuel ad make my brain feel like it was having a stroke an inspiring stroke but a stroke nonetheless nicely done mark,0
toby was the best peter parker but i think andrew and tom are better as spider man but i guess the culprit was the witing on sam raimi movies every scene was too serious spider man quips were almost non existent maybe they did that because the mask wasn t adequate for dialogues but he also doesn t talk to himself,0
seriously why is everyone sucking tobey s dick so much he wasn t that good as peter parker or spider man tom holland is the best live action spider man and spider verse is in a league of its own sure his movie series was unique and campy entertaining jj jameson and green goblin are amazing and arguably his series kicked of the golden age of comic book films but when it comes to tobey everyone s letting nostalgia dictate there opinions when compared to others he was a subpar spider man,0
i love these movies you pointing out certain things made me realize that i took a lot from them as a kid without even realizing at the time which makes me love them more thanks mark can t wait for next week,1
oh hi mark,0
,0
a man who can review properly without making it boring af,0
that g fuel ad does not need to go that hard,0
i uhh can t unsee james franco licking his lips,0
i remember watching this trilogy as a kid but i ve never looked at it as this complex and philosophical thanks mark you never fail to amaze me,1
hot take in the movies and the comics otto is a better arch nemesis for peter than norman is,1
wow just wow review,0
that was the best analysis of mary jane watson in these films i have ever seen,0
i actually liked spider man granted not as good as or but i didn t think it was bad even though that venom tobey montage was silly i saw that as peter trying to be what he thought was cool which cause he was a super nerd was really funny,0
so slight nitpick i noticed at the beginning of the film doc ock says knowledge is a gift not a privilege then at the end of the movie he says it is a privilege might of been a slip in the writer s room,0
mary jane is the worst in the classic trilogy,0
spider man while easily the weakest of the trilogy is not nearly as bad as its reputation would have you believe there s some good stuff in there,0
i know that you focused mostly on the live action movies but i m dying to see analysis from you of into the spider verse,0
little did i know i was feeling so nostalgic about the spiderman trilogy thanks it was an interesting breakdown,0
i liked the point made about his displays of stength vs his combat i reminds me that most people dont realize why hes so strong he isnt just super strong because hes a superhero is because spiders are typically dozens of times stronger than their body weight apply those same physics to a full grown human adult and you have a man who is insanely strong edit apparently its times their weight,0
holy mother of ad,0
mark i discovered your channel years ago in those years you became my favourite youtube channel love your reviews and your opinions keep up the good work man,0
i could be wrong on the physics but what if doc oc is using the mechanical arms as sock springs similar to the ones on your car,0
damn mark stop cutting onions,0
fixes for the flimsy plot choices in spider man harry should have faked his amnesia to slowly destroy peter s heart referencing goblin s in famous line in the first movie the symbiote should have been discovered by john jamison just like the in the comics and s show i think having spider man save the astronauts shuttle crashing in grand fashion would have explained why the city especially jj jamison suddenly views spider man as a hero in the third movie and harry faking his amnesia could have been a great twist,1
yes it s here,0
and this is when otto became heisenberg,0
this video is a mastapiece,0
i was eating bro,0
norman osborne is a fantastic spider man villain i hope he shows up in the mcu not counting the raimi version to show up in no way home as someone who has read spider man comics since the stories with norman osborne are almost always great i d like to see him develop over the course of several movies which is why it s disappointing to not even have him name dropped in the mcu yet,0
i love the way you covered the final message in spiderman that quote is my favorite,0
so spider man ultimately came down to talk no justsu,0
amazing review as always i m almost the same age as you so i too grew up with the animated series and then the raimi films and i agree with you for the most part still think venom looked bad in that film tough also what really hit me was when you mentioned the fear of your own death i suffer from that a lot too especially at night when i m trying to fall asleep i can feel like i m gonna lose my mind out of fear still don t know what to do about that feeling i start imagining they ll discover immortality or something in the next couple of decades to ease my fear but it still works only partly helps me get my mind off of it for a bit at least,1
i love seeing babyface joey diaz in spiderman two,0
is it weird that i pressed like on the vid for the ad lol but the video is amazing so far your taking is great even when it s not an anime i know,0
this video really got to me i got moved when you talked about aunt may s speech and when you talked about your losses and fears regarding your family and mortality last year i lost my father to cancer and started too to feel like my own mortality is too real ever since,0
there is actually a thing in the comics that explain why doc ock can fight peter and not immediately get slumpt and one besides peter holding back is the arms neuro link literally drags him around even if he s near dead there s a bunch of scenes where he is basically a walking corpse more puppet than man it actually leads to superior spiderman one of my favorite spiderman comics,0
mr sunday movies,0
i thought this was another cosmonaut spider man video when i clicked this thumbnail i was very confused when i suddenly heard totallynotmarks voice instead lol,0
what s the name of the piano song it s so beautiful wonderful job with this video btw thank you for sharing your perspective,0
topher grace as eddie brock was atrocious,0
enjoyed this however i would have crapped on venom more he s supposed to be a house not topher,0
didn t peter actually hit mj in comics too,0
the comics had a story about doc oc swapping bodies with peter ultimately leading pete to die i think anywya my point is that when doc oc was in peters body the first punch he threw broke a villains jaw off so i get your point but its there if yoy want to have a look,0
ngl after seeing this video i m looking forward to when if he does a video on the dark knight trilogy that would be great,0
mark i think you are looking at these movies with too much nostalgia and not being able to see the flaws they have aunt may would never and i mean ever get mad at peter for what happened and would comfort him in this moment instead in the comics and any other media aunt may is understanding and compassionate towards him in every regard the aunt may we see in these films has her moments but a lot of them aren t good or in character please watch cosmonauts variety hour video on this trilogy and you ll see what i m saying,0
i thought of a reason the butler didn t tell harry sooner he probably didn t want to tell him his father was a mass murdering psychopath and then by that point things had gotten out of hand,0
the take on the mask is a stupid one,0
great essay as always i don t agree with you with everything like your disdain towards the hard mask i feel like it separates the almighty hero from the flawed human or your appreciation for spidey but your opinion is cohesive and interesting i have one question though as i understand it you ll review the live action trilogies during december and all the videos that are left are either filmed or already scheduled through the holiday season but are you planning to review into the spiderverse i don t know your opinion about the film and it uses a different media but i feel at least based on my opinion and whoever i asked about the matter that the movie itself deserves a top spot among the spiderman films,0
raimi trilogy are the best superhero movies ever made the other two trilogies simply aren t going to match up they re nowhere near as thematically rich and full of heart and soul i expect the next to reviews to be they re good but,0
an incredible video mark and tea it was truly so refreshing to hear your take on the remi movies and especially with your review with number it was like a breath of fresh air not a lot of people see that side to it they only focus on the memey aspect of it and thankyou in that regard for changing my perspective on it i never realised that peter himself was the villain in spider man,0
i have to say the more i watch your channel the less sincere you come across from now on i ll just wait till you do some one piece stuff peace and love,0
may i just say that i love how doc oct received a tons of punches from spider man who has super strenght and he is all cool with it but he can t handle an old lady with an umbrella,0
i think the emotionless mask works better than if his emotions were clearly visible when he s wearing the suit we re seeing him as the civilians would as spiderman the cool friendly and strong protector of new york city seeing his emotions clearly behind the mask would show people how geeky uncertain and scared he is all the time which makes it more powerful in the moments where you see him fighting without a mask i pretty much agree with everything else you said and love your observations that make me respect the trilogy more than i already did,1
on the knocking out otto with a single hit part there s a part in the comics where i believe it s otto who switches bodies with peter and becomes spider man otto gets into a fight with the scorpion while he s in peter s body and punches scorpion s jaw clean off because he doesn t know to hold back that s how it s always been in the comics to my knowledge peter holds back enough to not break anything but has tremendous power even so yes he could knock out otto in one hit but where s the fun in ending the fight in one punch in a movie unless it s a one punch man movie,1
this was an awesome review i m tempted to go back and rewatch and again in particular there s a great consistency and flow in these three films they naturally blend from one into the next,0
they dont make superhero movies like this anymore,0
random uncle joey appears,0
my favourite is andrew garfield spiderman,1
yo this was a great breakdown of your opinion on the trilogy i love it hopefully you think about doing this for all of them,0
mark really showing off his movie making skills with that sponsorship,1
yeah as much as i wanted to see venom as a kid my mom a lifelong spider man fan said but he s not a classic villain and i realized later that he s not or wasn t at the time and that rami was much more interested in the s and s era rogues gallery so sandman was actually a really good pick but that the pressure to include a fan favorite meant that the narrative was going to get tugged and rami just wasn t going to maintain interest in a villain in retrospect though i know he s the fanbases meme boy i would have loved to see shocker and sandman team up over venom and sandman,0
video made me cry thanks for that,0
video made me cry thanks for that,0
yeah it s sometimes hard to get across just how stupendously strong spider man is in media even his own comics he s so much stronger than capt america or black panther he is definitely fluffing his punches all of the time it s in fact stated in the books that when he gets hit by someone who doesn t have super strength like a mook or thug he has to roll with the blow and that s often only because he chooses to get hit so they don t break bones hitting him spider sense is ludicrously broken too it all takes effort still he choses to come off weaker than he is so criminals don t start carrying say fifty call machine guns because guns can still kill him and cause lots of collateral damage at least that s my rationale in one of the books doc ock actually takes over spider man s mind or switches minds with spider man and doesn t realize how strong peter until he literally knocks scorpion s jaw off,0
i remember that part where doc oc took over spider man s body and got into a fist fight with scorpion but broke his jaw wtf spiderman was going easy on us,0
tobey s spiderman is the best character worst actor,0
the final fight in the first movie is actually extemely evil dead raimi does just about everything he did in those movies abandoned building setting camera movement following the character quite brutal hand to hand fighting in fact you can really tell the studio or someone told him to tone down the violence cause never again you see a fight scene this bloody and they used up as a base for yet another one of controversial hated spider man stories namely the fact that otto octavius is barely alive now after so many years of taking spider strength punches to the face,0
this one video is more personal than some other channels in this platform,0
i haven t watched these films since i was or but damn just watching this analasis reminds me why i loved those films as a child,0
to be fair mark regarding your issue with the damage per punch coming out of spiderman physical strength doesn t directly translate to striking power if a strongman went from pulling a train to punching a bag he s not going to strike with any where near the force of someone like bruce lee now spidey does have the striking power you see it when he lets go and goes hammer and tongs on a bad guy spidey was getting his webbed butt kicked by goblin in the first film until he went all out spiderman doesn t want to hurt people even bad guys murderers people directly threatening the lives of others spiderman wants to stop them not hurt them not even to save himself he only goes all out for others and when he does he wins,0
i always thought doc ocs arms attach to his spine and skull protecting his spinal cord and brain,0
would love to see you do something similar for the batman film coming out around march this is amazing,0
why tobey films were the best but most importantly the memes,0
why the fuck is scott morrison shown when talking about the toxicity of today s society granted any informed aussie knows that he is absolute dogshit and arguably one of if not the shittiest prime ministers we ve had the displeasure of receiving but why would folks from ireland and america know that,0
i love that you used the original font from the movie titles,0
the spider man game also does this with old double o he s a nice genuine person but slowly and downright sneakily he gives himself over to the darker sides of his personality in pursuit of his own ego something he d tried to keep in check and it s almost sympathetic if not for his methods,0
hello peter,0
this review made me realize something huge m ay n orman o tto and p eter,0
mans put more effort on the ad then the spiderman review lmao,0
that little section of you sharing your personal experiences kind of scared me a little not for just the material but also because the same stuff happened for me as well it s tough having a family that was once so tight knit feel a little distant of course the lockdowns and mandates haven t made it any easier not really knowing what i want of course just stresses everything that little bit further anyway i ll get back on track thanks so much for these essay style reviews i have been watching all of them and enjoyed every viewing again thanks for what you do and hope things are going much better now,0
peter was completely justified in his reply to harrys attack you cant swing a bat at someone and be a victim if they put in your chest you attacked first,0
i m totallynotmark and this is how i m going to make you cry for minutes,0
i like how you acknowlege good points of spiderman i think that s a great and moving story with too much slapstick meme scenes and overcomplicated subplots,0
missed an opportunity to call him amazing,0
my girlfriend never watched any spiderman so we binged all of it recently i had a great time the new movies seem to focus on the double relationship between peter parker spiderman and the main villain they re a little bit lacking in the emotional weight the other movies had though,0
i m always able to hear some kind of story structure in your vids and that s what make them so engaging for me great work,0
it s insane to think you loved these movies and never got around to watching it again not calling you a liar it s just hard to believe you never caught it somewhere on tv or the internet or never had any desire to rewatch it until now,0
thanks for the amazing review i can not stress this enough each review you do makes me appreciate the series movies or mangas alot more then i originally do and i thank you for that,0
damn i love bryce dallas howard,0
spider man gave us bully maguire a gift to humanity that keeps on giving,0
is that tom in the ads also ye great work d,0
i love your take on the video but a video request i d love for you to review the spiderman from the ps game he s probably my favorite spiderman and would love to see your take on it,0
on the topic of spidey not knocking out his rogues gallery in one punch they sort of acknowledge that in more recent years in the comics when doctor octopus took over peter s body and punches scorpion s jaw off in a single punch and basically thinks he could ve killed us at anytime if he wanted to,0
i remember watching this when i was like this is so nostalgic,0
i was planning on only watching the first film s review and the saving the rest for later but i just couldn t stop watching amazing review and fantastic video,1
as a person who grew up with these movies and made a huge impact on my life it was really amazing to see that everytime i watch videos about the trilogy i get to see the movies in ways i never thought i could thank you for adding another point of view to these movies,0
one little detail i only noticed because the latin spanish dub changed it is the line otto says after peter says that intelligence is a gift a privilege otto saw his intelligence as a privilege and while privileges come with a burden they also imply authority or even superiority pun definitely intended otto thought his intelligence his gift made him deserving of power the power of the sun in the palm of my hand peter never saw his gifts intelligence or spider powers as a privilege only as a burden and a responsibility that s why otto adds that little line an uninhibited otto was always going to be a villain because of this fatal flaw the line in the dub was it s not a privilege if you were curious,0
was that ad tom o regen,0
what s with the videos of trump don t tell me your a brainwashedlib too he literally did more for this country then any president in decades the advancements we made thanks to him were immeasurable and now thanks to the new man in charge who reversed everything he did we re living in an actual hell hole crime inflation open borders supply chain crises oil shortages empty shelves insane gas prices etc etc,0
i feel the mask is intended in universe even to hide peter s emotions as spider man quite intentionally to hide his fear both from his opponents and the citizens and to always show the face of spider man looking boldly forward it also does make the moments where the mask comes off that much more potent,1
oh my this was so good,0
spiderman is coming it s just called doctor strange,1
i m glad you saw spider man not as movie full of things that make it bad but you saw the movie what it wants to show i can t see spider man man as a movie full with memes but a movie that has characters that had a path of not giving it what they want but do what they can to help for sand man and eddie and venom is are victims of not living of what they think they can be,0
you mentioned vhs so now i have a heartbreaking story to share sit yourself down and have a calming tea because you ll coil in horror as i did the time was the early s i started watching dragonball z religiously as i was years old my mother then suggested she tape the series so we could always watch it back then we had a lot of power outages or times where we didn t pay the bills on time and had to work with what we got i can imagine you figured out what we did during these times as i had the vote of importance because i was the youngest the favorite even if it was never admitted we watched the tapes of course so much so that i knew lines by heart in the exact tone and gravitas it annoyed them to no end i had a blast fastforward to and we decided to for old times sake rewatch the entire series on tape but the quality was worse than usual usually because it s tape you have enormous static and grain making it hard to make out but never enough to care this time we couldn t see anything at times and the sound magically disappeared and reappeared whenever so we decided to take it out when we did oh my god the tape of the cassette got stuck inside the player and couldn t be salvaged it snapped like my soul that very moment what makes this worse is that it was the ocean dub combined with funi dub it s the rarest to find that tape was the only one of its kind and we never had the chance to put it on disc or online so now it s a memory that i have to take with me to my grave eu release you will forever be memorized by me and me alone the times you gave me with my family will never be outshined i hope that everyone has good memories like i do this time in my life was magical and i hope everyone experiences something like it at least once thanks for reading have a blessed day ps i found an ocean dub release online on piratebay the next year so i at least have some form of my childhood back it s not that different but the buu saga is not the same i remember vegito s voice being that of the funi dub but the lines were the exact same as that of the ocean dub in the ocean dub there is only a single voice that tries to emulate an amalgamation of both characters honestly it s a pretty damn good job of it too mad respect for the vas,1
holy shit tom killed that ad read,0
you just enforce my idea that the andrew garfield one is not the best written but still have better idea more entertaining character and that s why i will aknowledge mcguire as the best one while prefering andrew garfield by far,0
honestly looking back i feel that all three of them portray spider man peter parker well in their own ways like most have said tobey captures peter and the responsibility andrew had the personality of spider man and tom captures the youth i say tom is my favorite out of the three mainly because of his scene in civil war and homecoming my favorite version of spider man though is the playstation games and spectacular spider man and i like spider man for the same reasons you do especially since he is one of the few characters i can really relate to i can t wait to see the rest of your reviews mark,0
fine i ll buy g fuel,0
i guess the movie clips audio had to be censored for a reason or another but it unfortunately affects the video s narration and flow like at i dont know what the goblin s proposition was it is at least kinda comical in some ways,0
mark i m honestly speechless great work you inspire me man,0
i can t stand we are having new spiderkid instead of raimi s masterpieceses,0
that gfuel ad deserves a fucking oscar,0
i think andrew is underrated he isn t the best spiderman out of the three but he plays the best peter to me,0
thank you for your vulnerability bub as i m sure is with many have a similar story to tell over the past years thank you for your efforts stay safe and take care x,0
it s been ages since i ve seen the trilogy but it reminds me of why they re some of my favorite super hero movies the characters from villains heroes and civilians are so good really excited to see dr octopus from this series in no way home hopefully they do his character justice,0
ive read too much manga all the comic panels shown in this i read wrong lol,0
you know how much i ve sacrificed i sacrificed my fruitcake,0
so you made a review of my favorite movie trilogy ever made this ll be fun to look at i know that these films still mean a lot to people so when you said you haven t seen them in a while it was certainly going to be an interesting time watching this review since it was coming from such a different perspective than my own i watch these movies too much perhaps i m looking forward to seeing you review the various spider man movies,0
hey mark i noticed that editor san has put a lot of spider man ps music in this which fits perfectly for these reviews i know you may have your plate full with so many spider man movies but i do hope you take the time to check out and maybe one day review the spider man ps game the story and character of spider man in that game of peter parker it takes everything that worked in all three movie adaptations and in the comics and gave us a version of peter parker and spider man that just like the raimi version i think a lot of people sees themselves in for lots of us regardless of our takes of favorite movie spider man that game reminded us why we loved the spider man character as long as we did and reinforced it in a way that is just amazing idk i get pretty sappy and emotional with spider man stuff since that character means so much to me but i do think you d love the story of spider man ps,0
loved these films and this was a dope video side note can t wait for your review of wano act,0
toby mguire is hotter than keanu hot take deal with it,0
rosemary harris is best aunt may bar none,0
great video man hope you do a similar one on the nolan batman trilogy,0
i went and watched spiderman in theaters when it launched i think im going to cry at new way home,0
mark ur a goddamn great essayist ive been subscribed to u for so long and u keep inspiring me to embrace my creativity i love the og trilogy and spiderman is one of my favorite characters ever but i do feel that the spiderman within the ps version is easily the best i can tell ur a fan cuz of the music maybe if u have the time u could touch on it a little i know ur busy and if its too much i do get it ur awesome mark never change,0
andrew is slept on,0
isn t it s great that these films resonate equally with and year olds i remember very well how much i enjoyed spiderman in the theatre because it was funny and tragic and cool and also sometimes scary the third one was fine until i got myself a venom origin comic and realized i would have loved a more adult and failed eddy brock in my spiderman movies but the movie poster for spiderman stayed on my childhood room door lol,0
yea no macquire was not the best those people were clearly basing it off nostalgia,0
watching your review it really shows how spider man works so much better in concept than execution everything you said the themes the idea of peter being the true villain harry s arc they all work and should come together into a great story the problem is that it s a story that could never fit in a feature length movie too much of it had to happen off screen or in quick scenes that we don t get the same connection as in the first movies while i ve made the too many villains complaint myself before i genuinely believe that was just a symptom of the over ambition of the project i like to imagine a version of this movie where ended with peter realizing how far he d fallen and the climax is him fighting his personal demons and overcoming them to free himself from the symbiote then the fourth movie would be focused on him then facing the consequences of his prior failings but now with a full movie to let them show and develop rather than trying to fit that level of gravitas into the last half hour of an already break neck story,0

how dare you make me feel,0
i m pretty sure you just called me fat and on that day bully maguire was born,0
i m sure alot of people have gone through it but to hear you talk about your grandma and dad really hit home i was raised by my grandma my mom and my grandpa no dad in the picture my grandma died suddenly in the night a day after me and my kids were with her and it took everyone in my family by surprise a year later my mom died the same way but in even worse circumstances then the next year i took care of my grandpa as he lost his fight with alzheimers and parkinson idk i just wanted to thank you for showing me that someone else went through something similar,0
yeeessss tnm finally talking about spiderman,0
i might not agree with most of what you had to say about spider man as that is my least favorite film out of the trilogy even worse than spider man yes i know blasphemy however what you said at resonated with me a lot as something similar happened with me years ago during my formative years in high school i was diagnosed with depression and it got so mad i even tried to kill myself at least times i was lucky that each time i had someone to talk me off the ledge to make me if for just a split second feel better and think that life was worth loving if only for a bit longer eventually my mother took me to these doctors not sure the specific they were but they wanted to put me on antidepressants but i hated the idea it made me feel even worse after that she d take me out of school once a week to do something weather it was going to the beach ten pin bowling or even the movies we d do something and while everything helped nothing worked for long the fact i was being bullied at school whenever i was out in the open didn t help so i usually found myself in the library and we didn t have a big comic book section as i live in australia so i didn t grow up with comics the way other countries did i m only just getting into them now thanks to ebay and certain apps but anyway i discovered one particular comic it was a re release of amazing fantasy spider man s very first and at the time of release potentially only release but then it became super popular and here we are but what i read in that comic inspired me so much i had already seen the sam remi films and loved spider man but the way the comic book told peter s origins helped inspired me it was the book i borrowed most i read it probably at least times when i first found it in the library that day then borrowed it and every time i had to return it i d borrow it straight away again unless someone had their name down for it then i d always be checking in to see if its back yet or not and every time i felt down or depressed or suicidal i d read that comic it helped me get through high school i now have a copy of that very comic on my book shelf not because i need it anymore but just as a reminder of how bad things were and how far i ve come and how strong i am so yeah to a degree i know how you feel spider man and stan lee and everyone who worked on amazing fantasy saved my life maybe not directly or intentionally but they did it none the less,1
i think you might have one me over on pt i struggled with it and for a while the whole trilogy because of it but now im all in this trilogy walked so the mcu could run,0
i disagree with you so much about the suits being the problem you say his acting is stiff when he wears it isn t that kind of the point peter isn t spider man he s playing a persona when he wears that mask also i disagree with you on not feeling any emotion during the sadistic choice scene i felt all the emotion in that scene from tobey even when in the mask but that s just me,0
mark i don t want to sound like a fan boy but the term reviewer on youtube is lost most anime reviewers do just recaps but you actually do reviews because i did feel everything u described as a kid watching these movies mark plz don t sacrifice your integrity alot of ppl make content to just make a quick buck but u put a lot into your videos and i respect that this review made me feel and that takes a lot,0
hearing you didn t have an answer for what you wanted to do in life at is honestly an extremely comforting thing to hear as someone around the same age lol,0
i don t think including the villains in spiderman was a mistake like you said the were all created by peter i think the issue was making eddie be venom too soon had the other two been given a chance to confront peter together while he was black suited up and after he hurt mj it would have created a more centralized climax of all the various plots of the movie tying everything together into one if then as a result of this eddie got the symbiote it would have been a better way to lead to the climax it would have also served more time for harry to think things over before allying with peter and time for sandman to have a better character arc of his own to depict him as caught between good and evil further it would have allowed raimi to show peter apologizing to mj and her clearly agonizing over it before he finally saves her to cleanly end to movie the final fight would have been more of peter and harry with help from sandman defeating venom and eddie this would have created more flow and made all the chaotic plotlines seem far more intentional also one more thing i don t think venom should ever not be used as a mechanism so long as peter parker is in the story though i wouldn t have minded if he d had more of a character of his own jealous possessiveness of peter and anger and betrayal at being abandoned this would have also served to set him equal to norman and otto and created an interesting element for peter to agonize over,0
tom o regan cameo,0
this version of flint marco is one of the best spider man characters ever,0
stone ocean has been realist,0
i d honestly watch a marvel s spiderman and spiderverse review if you d do it great work mark,0
i felt that emotion in your voice and thank you for this watching the rami trilogy remains me of a time where i felt the happiest in my life after spider man i remember that when my social school life started to struggle their something i get from watching them i even thought spider man wasn t a bad film just misunderstood i think was people thought tobey macguire is the best spider man cause he made you like you and anyone can be spider man,0
i think spiderman is a way better superhero than batman and superman spiderman has way more human problems,1
now i feel so old,0
i absolutely love this i love this idea of reviewing all of the spider man movies leading up to the new one coming out in like two weeks and i am here for it mark and everyone that help make this keep up the amazing work and thank you for the excellent content,1
the superior spider man comic series touched on peter parker s strength he does pull his punches edit great video by the way i had a lot of fun watching,0
although superman is my favorite superhero these movies are just my pure childhood i m excited to see him return in the new movie but i already know they ll screw up his characterization they ll give him lame mcu comedy just how doc ock looks really goofy in the trailers but they better play his theme,1
yooooo i also got the vemon part of the animated series but on dvd and it was awesome man,1
so how can the movies solve the problem with spider man s mask,1
for those of you reading this please take note that i m about to talk about religion and it may or may not offend some of you and you may disagree with me but that s totally normal and pleass do not leave any mean comments or any negativity i only wish to help those seeking for an answer about what happens after death for anyone who also shares that fear of death do not be afraid death is a fate we are all destined to experience there s no you can do to escape it although you can live longer you ll still die after and you honestly shouldn t be worried what you should be worried is where do i go and what happens next i myself had thought about this long ago i thought about death at the age of and was terrified of it but then i heard the good news that we don t have to say goodbye but instead say see you later for we have a saviiour that can give us eternal life in heaven the lord jesus christ gave us eternal life in his kingdom and all we have to do is pray to him accept that we are sinners and that we need him in our lives think about what you ve done recently have you ever lied have you ever stolen something before have you ever talk behind your friends family s backs have you ever looked into a woman with lust if so then you are a sinner my friend and you have sinned against our father but do not bs afraid for he is a loving god he will welcome you bless you and forgive you for the many sins you and i have done and if you think oh but i ve never killed raped harrassed hurt or wronged anyone so that means i m not a sinner that is not true my friend the bible tells us that as it is written there is none righteous no not one so even if you think your sin is far better than some other man who had sin much worse than you you re still wrong for any sin is an offense to god but i will tell you that if you surrender yourself to god and admit to him that you are a sinner and you repent from it and that you need his power to help you in your life then you will be saved my friend pleass do not wait for when death comes knocking for then it shall be too late get saved now and know this my religion nor any other religion will save you only the lord can do that for he paid the price for our sins all we have to do is believe and worship him i am a bible baptis tchristia and i wouldl ike you to have this amazing news that god has given us thank you all for listening and as a farewell i will leave this bible verse for you all for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved romans,0
i don t watch marks videos for the review anymore i just watch them for the g fuel ads,0
this has to be one of your best videos yet man i m still not even done with it but this is for sure one of your absolute best,0
i watched these movies once when i was like and i still remember spiderman stopping the train i tried watching the first one a year ago and i thought it was cringe,0
italian spiderman is the best spider man movie,0
i m not a fan of these movies anymore but damn can mark so eloquently make these movies seem so much greater than they are don t get me wrong i was a fan when i was a kid but going back to watch them as an adult other than willem dafoe and alfred molina i didn t find these movies all that appealing anymore especially the trio of peter harry and maryjane just my opinion but still good stuff mark keep it coming,0
hey man good job i cant say i know you but i m proud of you,0
rise and yeah boi time to get some gfuel,0
wait what there was a poll well i would ve voted for tobey anyways,0
the trilogy was supposed to be a quadrilogy and bruce campbell was going to be mysterio which explained why he was always somewhere in the previous films,1
every time i almost forget that phil lamarr was an extra in spiderman and every time i remember it always brings a smile to my face,0
every youtuber capitalising off of no way home hype lol,0
i love how you used marvel s spider man ps soundtrack,0
this video is beautiful it gave me a new appreciation and love for the sam rami movies,0
i love the raimi trilogy my eyes are always glued to the screen awhile back i saw that the st movie was playing on tv and man i didn t know how much i missed tobey,1
for this whole moment i have a similar experience but from a different point of view i had cancer last year and while i no longer have it my body is a shell of what it used to be i was in the army at the time as well and in the best shape of my life and from march to now it is extremely difficult to do certain tasks like lifting something heavy walking somewhat fast or even jogging to even yelling if the situation calls for it since my heart rate in all of those examples sky rockets and basically drops me the thing is physically i m painfully aware that i can t do anything i used to do but mentally i still can t come to terms with it more than a year later i constantly have friends and family constantly telling me to be careful and just very worried for me when before they used to think i was the invincible one but are now more concerned for me more than they ever have been it a very hard feeling to come to terms with,0
spider man is my favorite hero for all the reasons you stated in that poignant closing statement you gave i saw the first raimi spider man in the theaters times and i ve never done that for any movie since this came at a good time for me as i m going through having to make some difficult choices which including giving up some dreams so thank you mark and everyone who worked on this,0
i m not crying you re crying,0
great video but that s maybe the best ad for anything i ve seen in a youtube video,0
the third one even if it s not as strong as the first two is still a good movie and doesn t have nearly as many flaws as people make it out to be it s just that its development of the villains is a bit inconclusive as full stories because there were villain stories being cooked while peter s own story was also being cooked so kind of important storylines sandman harry the symbiote and eddie combined as storyline kinda because of how he ends up being a villain and peter even though it s not perfectly developed it has great stories in there it just needed to have a few more scenes of each and it would ve been perfect it s like you order dishes of food and each comes with only of what they should ve come with it s still a good amount they re not small dishes enough to be too small just needed to have a bit more on each part but the finished product is still good even if it s not fully completed and the stories being told were at parts good and at parts great sandman s was nice even though it wasn t finished but enough for him to have a purpose so i liked him as a villain he got the daughter thing and the uncle ben thing it was enough a bit flat but he did get motivation and even backstory and peter forgives him knowing that he himself made many errors and hurt people and decided to just forgive him and put stuff in the past since sandman killing ben was not intentional harry was great it s not like he needed a lot more than what he got he got to fight peter confront him be hurt by him ended up being a villain when he fought him at night and then helped in the final fight and died and we already had seen him in the first movies so the cake was already baked well enough the symbiote well with peter it was great it gave him power but also corrupted him peter had many scenes showing that so on that part it was amazing peter dancing and being a douche is in character with the symbiote making him be selfish and stuff it s funny out of context but it s not a flaw of the movie or anything that makes the movie worse by any means the audience disliking bully maguire is exactly what peter acting like a douche because of the symbiote should ve caused and did then with eddie it was great as a threat to peter too because venom was very powerful the only thing missing was a bit more development for eddie even though it wasn t really needed in the movie s context eddie had already been fired because of peter had extremely fresh resentment towards him the symbiote got him and told him it was peter and both of them wanted him eddie to destroy him and the symbiote too but it kind of wanted for peter to be his host if possible the thing is both wanted to hurt peter and about peter he had a lot of development in this movie too he could ve used a bit more to match what he had in the first movies had there not been other important plots but it was still great because it didn t rush the symbiote making him selfish it really had many scenes of him being like that so i never understood the actual points of why so many people say that the third one is bad apart from people disliking bully maguire which is actually the strongest aspect of the movie making so many people dislike the hero s actions when they re supposed to the villains not having enough development as the others in movies and venom not being as great as everyone expected which is the same as the point above this but enhanced by it being so expected to be great and with almost everyone saying that it s a bad movie people will jump to that conclusion too omitting that it never reaches the bad level it s a special case of the movie not having enough scenes but also not having too few to make it bad but it was never a bad movie or anything close to that it s just one of those pieces of art kind of buried by the oh it s bad comments when it s actually good overall it was great in many ways it was decent with others the characters act like they re supposed to act with what happens to them in the movie it just needed some more scenes to be really strong but it s jarring how people just ignore how the characters and stories are good and just see how there should ve been more scenes or one less villain as if the final product weren t good on its own when it is a movie can be the weakest part of its trilogy have problems and still be good,1
he might just not be able to pull his punches in a way that would hit ko someone he knows he can t hit them full power but he s not midoryia he can t control his power in perfect percentages he might just be throwing his arms with no power at all because he is afraid any power behind his punches might kill,0
i think tom holland is the best spider man however toby s movies are better than tom s but it seems like no way home is gonna be a knockout,1
mark you spoke to me in of my friends died and even to this day i feel afraid of my mortality,0
would be pretty funny of what otto was missing was dipping his reactor in water and he just did it too late,0
beautifully stated good sir,0
let s fucking go,0
tobey is the worst spiderman and his movies are good in spite of him not because of him,0
you kinda touched on it with the first movie but they know well about the restrictions of the mask that s why in every spider man film in around the climax he gets unmasked or his mask gets damaged so his face becomes visible it s the only way to accurately capture his emotions without diving into the comic method of his eyes being expressive through the mask even the holland mcu films did this and he more or less does have the shifty eyes in them,0
yo what the fuck making me cry over new york coming together over spider man in the train scene wonderful video absolutely loved it you ve given me a new appreciation for the subtlety and nuance in what i thought were set piece popcorn cruncher movies,0
let s go tobey,0
totally not mark can i send you money for this masterpiece of a video oh my gosh,0
haven t finished the rest of the video yet but i somewhat disagree some scenes especially with andrew s spider man i feel uses a lot of body language and camerawork to make the viewers feel almost every ounce of emotions there is to give without the help of cgi edit just finished the video and it s pure chef s kiss makes me love spider man even more,0
to this day nothing has beaten raimi s sm,0
but for real naruto better,0
unsubbed reported for violence and repulsive content,0
wow from that survey idk how to take it i thought tobey did amazing as peter parker but garfield did amazing as spiderman and holland has a balance dead in the center of making it feel like a single character,1
why did i think that advertisement was the trailer or something of the spider man sequel,1
oh no i already disliked this video but then you referenced hitop films i think i m going to unsubscribe,0
ugh i already know the new spider man movie is going to undue some character development for doc ock hopefully it s not too bastardized and written well,0
i always felt spider man to be the most relatable hero be in marvel dc or anime he has powers but just enough to stir the imagination and to manage to limit him to smaller problems peter is always as important as the hero himself and he as a person just feels like anyone of us and this original trilogy just shows all of this so perfectly,1
that gfuel add was shot very well nice way to integrate an add to a vid,0
so even the best movie have power scaling problem huh,0
human spider spider man,0
ah yes spider man my favourite manga,0
couldn t agree more however this aunt may is easily the worst of any adaptation literally my least favorite character other than mary jane i like gwen stacy more the either of em and she s terrible,0
these films were the pillar of my imagination as a child spiderman had always been my favorite super hero and to me tobey is spiderman,0
bro have haven t watched the video yet i m about to i just gotta say this that s some phenomenal artwork up there with you re white haired goku incredible,0
and i cried,0
,0
when i saw spider man i was like or and sandman was my favorite character but overall i loved the movie,0
this was fantastic if you haven t already i d also recommend the spider man episode of the film review series really that good,0
sorry to hear about your grandma my grandma had just passed away two days ago but i m not sure from what,0
was that gfuel ad making fun of car commercials,0
this was such a great video essay thank you for this video in a time where this trilogy is mainly looked back on for the memes it created it s nice to be reminded of why i really held these movies so dear to my heart as a kid,0
finally im not the only one that likes toby anymore,0
yooo thanks for including the mvc spider man theme always a banger,1
this is probably the greatest review of this series i ve seen so far ive always known the morals messages and lessons of these movies it s just i ve always had a hard time explaining them not only to myself but others almost every point made in this video i completely agree with i saw raimi s first spider man barely over the age of in and the profound impact it made on me has followed me into my adulthood and will transcend all the way to my death the bit where you talked about may s speech in genuinely made me cry because this movie inspires me the same way it does you thank you for this review can t wait to see my generation s spider man on the big screen again in a few weeks,1
i didn t watch the third film when me and my friends where speculating who the next villain would be i said well it cant be venom he would need his own trilogy it has to be harry green goblin then i found out they were doing venom i was like there is no way they ll do it right i m out,0
tobey has the best stories tom has the best age appropriate actor not to say tobey is a bad actor he just suffers from early s yo high school kid syndrome,0
tobey s spider man is the luke skywalker of all spider man,0
ok no offense mark i love your videos but there is just nothing spiderman you could say that i haven t heard already i mean i love spiderman like a lot of other people but i dont like when channels i thought kind of did things i ve never seen before for example the dragon ball redraws just start to fall in this homogeneous youtube standard pit i just hope you won t because it s just not what i came here for i am a bit dissapointed that i loose a whole month worth of content and that it came more or less short notice i know that berserk and naruto are a lot of work too but i would ve liked to at least have naruto or berserk video in the month berserk is taking it s time anyways so it is really discouraging at least to me who got into the manga and now i ll have to wait an extra month for the berserk review even though this was the reason i finally subscribed tbh i only started watching the other videos to kill time until berserk comes back i still hope you ll have a great rest of the year i know i am most likely alone with this but i ll think about subscribing again when this is over i just think you can do better i mean your ads show that you clearly have something going in the comedy department hope you ll never loose this spark worrying greets,0
who s spider man,0
,1
doc oc probaly stayed alive from those punches because of the arms that are part of him biologically idk,0
fantastic video i often kinda dismissed the first movie just because it gets overshadowed so much by the second one but you gave me a newfound appreciation for the film and the character of norman if you haven t seen it yet i definitely recommend watching the spectacular spider man animated series so far i think it s the best attempt at modernizing the character in popular media,0
great job mark and your team i really liked your analysis of these movies they made me remember what my first encounter with spiderman felt like when i was a kid thank you for this trip down memory lane most of the arguments you make reminded me of what i like about these sam raimi movies showing real world struggles and how to overcome them unity against a common threat and how the topics of hope responsibility and positivity are handled but as good as this video was for me there something that just boggles me i just can t agree with your analysis of mary jane i mean she was okay but kinda forgettable in the first movie serving mostly as mary sue motivation for peter she still had salvageable scenes those that had those first love vibes the awkward but cute interactions with peter then from the second movie onwards i ve despised her character found her obnoxious self centered bipolar and overall annoying she s always whining crying screaming or displays a bad quirk either in her lines or her facial expressions it s evidently not kirsten dunst s fault great actress and getting better everytime i see her in movies but her character is written so poorly and so superficially boo hoo she had a tough childhood and yay she wants to sing in broadway that she really bothers me everytime i watch these movies i m probably one of the few people for whom that slap scene in the third movie felt like salvation lol looking forward to the next spideycember video though can t wait,1
i ve never clicked on a video so fast and gave it a like before it even started,0
video made me cry why would you do this to me,0
hiya,1
that quote has always stuck with me even now i remember that line almost word for word and it s so damn no its fucking powerful to me i m glad to know what you said here was not just me that moment was always my favorite and that line was truly amazing,0
the scene with doc ocs wife gave me a fear of breaking glass i still have to look away right before the glass hits his wife too,0
mark you would never realize how much of the breakdown of spider man s struggles i can relate to i can t exactly explain why but i know i need to tell you this when faced with life s greatest question will i die there truly is an answer found within a humble book many have despised it and many have dismantled it for their own evil purposes the holy bible i know this may sound cliche but i myself haven t found any mistakes or inconsistencies deep in the writings from the many years i have read it however i am mainly pointing to the gospel of jesus christ who jesus has changed me for all eternity ever since i put my faith on him and repented from my own evil sins i can boldly say i am not afraid of death or anything after for if the one who created it and defeated it i have trusted in there is no evil in life s end anymore i loved your video so much and i rarely give thumbs up on youtube videos i will pray that god will bring you to right person or you will find the truth that is a true christain life may god bless your day p s your videos have helped me immensely with a novel i am righting i hope you will be able to read it someday,1
honestly when i was a kid spider man was my favorite because of venom and mary jane i was weirdly enough a year old who loved seeing the main hero be psychologically tortured idk it is what it is,0
mark do you have any chance reviewing a malaysian animated series called boboiboy,1
this was great i thought i wouldn t be as hyped because it s not one of my beloved animes or mangas but by the end i ve come to the realization that it s you more than the subject that makes your content fantastic regardless of the subject you slay bro,0
ish you talk about spider man pulling his punches in regards to doc ock this is something that they brought up in the superior spider man comics where doc ock takes over peter s body and life it helps him to start down a similar journey of with great power all because he punches the jaw of off scorpion and he realizes how much peter had held back over the years,0
after you do all the live action can you spectacular spider man i think it one of the best adaptation of spider to date,0
and then seth the programmer tries to act like mark is not good at looking for the value and message of fictional works,0
man i kinda want mark to review everything love his style and how he highlights so many aspects of everything he dives into,0
one thing they need to address in no way home is the lie in the trailer strange saying they all died versing spiderman we know sandman didnt die at the end of spiderman,0
we need a counter in the corner of the video for how many times mark says this film,0
man i don t know what it is but listening to mark do these reviews makes me so emotional like way more emotional then just watching the source material ever does,0
mark you just made my day,0
you are amazing at dissecting stories in such a captivating manner great video,0
fun fact the train scene in spider man was not filmed in new york because there s barely any elevated trains in manhattan it was filmed in chicago instead,0
sm is really overhated i loved it as a kid for sandman and even for just showing venom,0
i disagree with your logic on the mask part but i agree it does lack the ability to visibly emote through it but the part about his humanity being lost that seems a bit of a jump in my opinion but in way you can say it helps himself separate peter from spiderman that s always been a plot point through the comics and movies but i digress,0
i ve always believed that would ve been better if black suit peter had been the bulk of the movie had an inner struggle scene near the end of the film with the film ending with the cliffhanger of venom setting up spider man,0
my god that ad was great,0
my ears perked up when i heard the spider man ps theme such a great song,0
this video is incredible amazing there is one nitpick i have however when you say it made more than the last two movies off of the promise of venom alone it really cheapens the fact that there were two fantastic movies that came before i have no doubt that venom really boosted those numbers but the better a movie is the more people turn up for the next one,1
man i wanna say your content is why i subscribed but your commercials is why i joined seriously a cinematic master piece,0
mark you had me teary eyed throughout this video especially when you kept highlight aunt may i definitely relate but man at you had me in genuine tears really sorry to hear about your family struggles thanks for still making all the amazing content,1
i think this is a pretty common thought but tobey best peter parker garfield best spiderman holland best mix of both,0
sand man just ate the suna suna no mi,0
i want to see tom holland spider man saving more people not by saving the world but close and personal,0
can t wait to see the mark review the other spiderman movies,0
wait this isn t a goku,0
bravo,1
ok but why did that butler keep that secret from harry though he did not really have a good reason to keep it a sectet it was kinda dumb that the butler revealed it out of nowhere,0
otto had an icarus moment,0
i find it so crazy that nobody really notices that otto says intelligence is a gift not a privilege and at the end when peter reminds him of that quote otto calls it a privilege definitely a script mistake,1
lets go bully maguire time spiderman time,0
i really like the use of the spider man ps theme playing in the background it s a great and powerful theme,0
tobey is the best simply because he s spiderman not the iron spider or tony stark jr,0
i have had the honor of meeting rosemary harris she is one of the kindest individuals i ve met and beyond that incredibly talented and as far as i know she spends her time now teaching her skills to a number of college students in my state if you ever get the chance to meet her take it,0
are you gonna review the japanese spiderman too,0
is it just me or does the narrator for the g fuel advert sound increadibly handsome,0
the ad is badass as usual,0
honestly raimi s trilogy is legendary definitely something everyone should show their kids in the future also i hope no way home doesn t give the feeling of where s tobey for most the film which it probably will whether he s underutilised for only minutes or in the majority of the film he better teach tom holland s spiderman a good lesson maybe one of aunt may s or uncle ben s because god knows he needs it,1
mark you forgot to mention that one of the lessons that spider man teaches us is to just throw some dirt in someone s eyes if they mess with you too much,1
i think peter literally can t hit otto harder they showed how tied his emotions were to his powers so i think the emotional connection and how much he doesn t want to hurt otto make his punches weaker,1
spider man is my favorite not the best because it showed me that no matter how you start or where you are in life you can always choose the light and be the good person you should be spider man is the best overall but really hit that point home for me the most,0
dude the suit from these movies is so good it looks like cg to me even the practical scenes,0
hey mark i just want to say thank you for making this great content for us i ve been watching your videos since the summer of and you have really changed my perspective on storytelling and writing before it was something i could care less about but now it s something i find absolutely fascinating i also now find character and story analysis super interesting and fun because of you tysm i look forward to every thursday now because of you i love your content keep up the amazing work,1
screw anime this is a spider man channel now,0
amazing review,0
incredible one could say even spectacular video keep it my friend,0
me looking at the thumbnail of the video,0
i don t comment on videos normally this video changed that amazing video mark a classic series from my childhood,0
i will not die a monster that line,0
bro im sorry but seeing joey diaz made me laugh my ass off i forgot he was in sm you gotta get thru me cocksucka,0
what a beautiful video,0
mark finds a way to appreciate media that sometimes escapes me finding great aspects of stories that are often overlooked based,1
andrews is so underrated they are really good films he does a good job and the story is really good it makes sense has a teenager trying to be normal and be spider man we see him become a hero from being full of anger and vengeance to a to a mature hero well as mature as peter can be he shows his anger at the death of ben and how it was actually kinda his fault for being angry even down to the awkwardness of him and gwen at first is the best in terms of how awkward teens are i wish they added some of the deletes sense because it show even more of andrews talent for me he s the best spidey,1
way to knock this out of the park the ad was pretty funny with that great review in the books what do you think are some of the best qualites of the other spiderman movies have over the original trilogy,0
weirdly enough out of the spider man is my favorite of the trilogy but i also admit that s probably because i m a sucker for sandman and this being my introduction to venom my favorite villain in comics,0
the new york isnt accurate theres no crackheads or black people,0
lets just ignore the fact that mj tried to betray peter with spidey the first chance she got,0
the guy on the right is samurai jack voice,0
thank you for shoutout to alex ross his work speaks for itself but people need to hear about it somtimes kingdomcome,0
bold of you to assume spiderman was my favorite i mean you re right but still bold of you,0
i don t think you can hold it against andrew garfield a lot of people didn t like the movie for reasons other than him plus you have tom holland who is arguably the best and then you have tobey maguire who is the original and i am not convinced that half the people who say tobey maguire is the best aren t just saying that out of some nostalgia bullshit,0
i don t think spiderman wants to knock doc ock out he doesn t want to inflict lasting brain damage he s just trying to tire octavius out or otherwise get him to stop trying to hurt other people,0
i think should review the live action batman films sometime later,0
idk why but this video just made me want mark to go trouble and review all of the god of war games even if it s only the main,0
as much as a i love tom holland s spiderman tobey maguire s spiderman hit different andrew is still ok and not in anyway shape or form a bad spiderman and i still think he did a great job as well sr tobey nd tom rd andrew,0
comment,0
may i ask for a review of arcane its pretty good as far i think,0
i always felt like tobey had the best peter parker but his spiderman lines were a little cringey sometimes andrew garfield was and awful peter parker but definitely the funniest spiderman and tom holland strikes a good balance between the two also tom holland isnt in his s as the character lol,0
i hope you reveiw spiderverse because thats the best out of all of these,0
oh please review the dark knight trilogy after reviewing the spider man movies,0
you say that peter and mj are a good couple but honestly i ve never seen anyone as petty and manipulative as raimi version of mj she s the worst,0
did you seriously refer to lucy lawless as an extra to fisticuffs good sir,0
i have never gotten as emotional listening to one of your videos as i did today amazing job as always this for me will be one of my favorite videos you ve ever done and one i will rewatch a lot,0
having lost my grandma this yr and having nvr been able to come to grasp it and losing my grandpa aunt mays words brought me to tears,1
i hope this blows up it s a great video,0
,0
the raimi films are really proof that sometimes deviating from the source material can work in service of telling a satisfying narrative sure andrew garfield plays a more accurate peter parker the flirty trickster who tried to get back at his bullies sure tom holland s films nailed peter s admiration for other heroes the sitcom nature of peter s high school life and finally de emphasised uncle ben but still the fact that tobey s spider man isn t the most comic accurate doesn t make the films any less great,0
i don t really get why there s an old timey tv effect here,0
mark thank you for this video man,0
am i the only one who would love to see some more marvel and maybe some dc stuff from mark after spideycember,0
commenting for the algorithm,1
to call upon the point of spider man s fights and him being super strong but not beating these villains in one punch obviously spider man holds back his punches in every battle he s in across all media spider man is amazingly powerful and strong to the point that he s one of the strongest humans out there what s impressive about spider man s feats when out of combat is that they tell just how much he holds back during fights in the comic superior spider man otto octavious makes mention of just how freaking strong spider man is so i wouldn t say it s an issue that s just spider man s morality thought i d pop that in,0
man like mark really popped off on this video love it love it love it cant wait to see what you come out with next bro you re one of my favourites also up ireland,0
i see you using that sweet marvels spider man ps soundtrack good one,0
mark is like the anime movie version of whitelight love both of them equally,0
what a fantastic video really well done and even moved me to tears in some sections you did good especially all your editors too,1
nd one has always been my favorite of this triology i still rewatch it alot i enjoyed the first and third ones but the nd is my favorite,0
raimi planned for to be with dr curtis connors the lizard its a shame we never got to see that especially since he dropped some easter eggs in it from the other films like the radio mentioning him but hey atleast we got to see sandman and the cgi team make the symbiote and the sand look amazing,0
mark you re a mortal kombat fan,0
thank you everyone i know loves to bash the original spider man trilogy as a campy awkward mess i often find myself defending it constantly when it comes up in conversation you have given me more fuel to use in my battles against the maguire deniers thank you,0
amazing video mark but you missed a golden opportunity to have aunt may say hold on a second longer while peter was holding the train as it began to fall,0
i like this video in conceit and execution,0
i stopped watching at to say this before i continue the rest of this masterpiece of a review to say this i love spider man regardless of what people say i also wish the hate wasn t so bad so we could have gotten spider man,0
having displayed spidey enough that face shell sure does a lot to prevent getting lip spit on your mask and maintaining a smooth aesthetic but i do understand why you feel having the light lip outlines adds to more of spideys character anyways mark dont miss and looking forward to the next video about my spider man anfield gardrew,0
look i ll stand toes down for andrew garfield he was and is my favorite live action spider man,0
not only i enjoy the meaning of what sam raimi presented throughout the trilogy but his amazing way of using different genres he worked on previously to enhance different scenes exclusively the horror genre for the villains it scared the living crap out of me as a kid watching green goblins hidden appearance in the apartment burning aunt may being attacked in her home and the climax fight between green goblin and spider man not only that he improved it in the second movie something i would activatly skip as a kid since i can t handle scary scenes but now it adds so much depth to each character when it happens,0
great review these videos never disappoint sorry to hear about your loss and the difficulties you suffered in the last year now i gotta watch asm before next week s video hope you re able to fit in a review of into the spider verse too,0
actually my head canon here for why pete doesnt knock out ock immediately in the train fight is he essentially needs to interrogate ock for mjs location we see in his fight with ock in the warehouse that he can ko ock in like punches when he needs to but ock always puts something in his way before pete ever had the change,0
though i love alex ross rendition of any superhero those skin tight costumes probably wouldn t look good in motion,0
tom helping with the gfuel ad is icing on top of an already amazing cake,0
great work man great work,1
i loved this video mark i resonate a lot with you on spider man,0
excellent review man though there are some aspects i didn t like about the reimi trilogy i still love it for how the films brought out the human qualities of the character of spider man my childhood would not be complete with these movies or the cartoons airing at the time can t wait to see how you ll tackle the amazing spider man next week,0
that was a good g fuel advertisement mark,0
mark your a great guy sadly i feel your loss be safe be good love your work,0
i think this is the best video i ve ever seen of yours really looking forward to the next,0
he did not understood raimi s venom shaking my sadge,1
if you re going through each spidey movie will that include spiderverse,0
i still disagree that spider man works with villains i do like spider man but it could have been so much better without venom i still want black suit spider man though eddie brock should have been what harry was in the prior films a background character that sometimes steps into the forefront with his b plot but the future menace that he portrays left for a future movie even knowing that th would never come due to tobey s injuries sandman was picture perfect as a villain in the raimeverse and black suit spider man seeking revenge was very compelling hindsight being if i had the choice i would push eddie further into the background remove venom entirely and replace the intro with the failed shuttle mission fro the s cartoon where spidey saved jx and got the venom symbiote that way get rid of the amnesia or make it a red herring while harry purposely messes with peter s life by pretending to be normal again and have the film end with the climactic battle with sandman new goblin both and at the very end show the church scene and tease venom for a primary role in perhaps have peter maim and nearly kill harry as the driving force along with striking mary jane to remove the black suit and have harry s recovery and redemption be his arc in the supposed th movie with venom as the sole antagonist,1
great video i was wondering since you mentioned about the s spiderman tv show if you familiar with the spectacular spiderman tv show or plan in the future to express your opinion on different tv spiderman interpretations,0
you have my attention again,1
you have my attention again,1
you have my attention again,1
you have my attention again,1
you have my attention again,1
i m going to be honest out all youtubers that dedicates to deep reviews in media s this video made me tear thanks mark as far as i know you let know that there is still a chance of hope for this world,0
for the critique about tobey s mask muting his expression and emotion i actually kinda like that decision it fits the stoic hero persona he has to put on while leaving his body language and the tone of his voice to express his emotion in a more subtle way similar to a character like master chief from halo which is perfect imo,1
i d love to get your thoughts on arcane,0
yo mark in my opinion is the best reviewer i listen to his combination of details literary views and personal shared experiences make his reviews levels above any other keep them coming man,1
fun fact the face shields were made to have movable jaw pieces for spiderman but i guess it didn t show up well on screen i still think the hang on scene during the bank fight really showed his emotion through the mask,1
is he reviewing andrew garfield s spider man next week,1
getting a no way home ad on a spider man video targeting advertising sure figured me out,0
if i get anything wrong please feel free to correct me cause it s been a while since i read comic books and haven t read a lot of recent stuff the nitpick with spiderman strength that i find hilarious is that only other earth hero are physically stronger hulk the thing and thor spoiler i guess also in one come book issue i forgot which one spideman and doc ock switch bodies and doc oct punches a guy i believe accidentally and break his jaw and doc ock come to the realization that spiderman has been holding back so much and is probably one of the funniest thing i remember in the comics,1
if you start reviewing all kind of movie please do it for how to train your dragon ahah,0
praise god,1
this was an emotional rollercoaster first this funny ad then your private story that actually made me cry hope your dad is good now and at the end i always thought about how i as a kid liked spidy the moste because black spidy more cool black spidy go zoom,1
i hope the new movie wouldn t use him as a joke too much but also captures his heartfelt side more,0
godspeed totally not mark,1
ok first of all amazing analisis since i was a child and for stupid that may sounds i always took great inspiration from the character of spiderman the resilience and willpower of a guy that keeps fighting in any way even if he have everything against him is for me maybe the best and most inspiring of the modern era mythos spiderman is easily the best portrait of the character in live action motion picture media rosermary harris as aunt may have the proper words for any situation and she always nail it with the performance and well after your analisis of the train fight escene i need to re re re replay the ps spiderman xd keep doing this magical thing you do man,0
as hyped as i am for no way home i m really worried about the villains being glossed over especially given how half of them aren t that bad of people,1
if he liked spider man i feel like mark s gonna be pleasantly surprised by tasm i didn t love the andrew garfield films growing up since i grew up with the raimi films but honestly tasm may just be better than the mcu spidey films at least in certain regards it s on par with spider man if you were to ask me maybe even just a little better than it due to the story s focus on peter and his search for his parents plus we get to see some more of that egotistical behavior before peter learns to be spider man akin to what mark was talking about in the origin story from the comics and i wish i didn t go into that film originally when i was younger with such a heavy bias now tasm it has good moments and still feels more like a spider man film than the mcu titles despite its problems but that movie is undoubtedly a train wreck i won t go about defending the awful dialogue at parts in the film or how poorly harry osborn was implemented and how unnecessarily edgy he comes off as but the idea behind electro s character was at least somewhat interesting albeit poorly executed and the relationship between peter and gwen in the film still felt pretty fleshed out and awkward at least in terms of the acting the dialogue is kind of dog shit at points which is in character for tasm s peter parker so yeah i m really curious to hear what mark s thoughts are on both the mcu spider man films and little tony stark jr along with tasm and garfield s spider man,1
i mean your observations were valid but i felt that you gave certain moments more weight than they deserve in other words it isn t that deep bro do you by any chance happen to have a degree in art philosophy literature or writing i just noticed that people with those types of degrees often tend to have this style of analysis i m just curious msybe i m slightly biased,0
marks g fuel ads are they only ads i don t skip,0
im removing my like after that squid game scene,0
off topic but dosen t this spider man technically die in spider verse the main spider man of miles universes gose through all the events of these movies so is tobey spiderman dead or is that just a spider man that just had the same events happen to him sense tobey and spider man from spider verse do look different,1
i love tom holland,0
i know a lot of people might complain about mj s performance but i feel the issue isn t the acting but the writing of kirsten dunst s lines the writing of the raimi films is mostly great but i do feel that they didn t write the romance well nor do the films pass the bechdel test i still think the films are great but they definitely have their weaknesses,1
i absolutely love your love for the aunt may speech the train sequence those are my favorite parts of spider man and i tear up every single time going into spider man i don t think it is a crap film i just think there are certain parts of it that are crap at the end of spider man mary jane tells peter that she wants to face these dangers challanges of spider man with him her character in this movie contrasts that wickedly i get the desire of her wanting to feel loved and i have my feeling abnout peter and that stunt with the kiss but i ll get into that in a moment as for mary jane her struggles with life in the theater love both make no sense and had simple solutions there should have been no issue hearing her singing as she should have been mic d even putting that aside she was still doing great with straight plays every time she has a chance to tell peter what s going on or how she s feeling she choses not to she s handling this whole situation like a martyr it feels more like she s upset that peter spider man s getting all this attention and not her this all felt avoidable as for peter and his cockiness before he even gets the symbiote let s break down his journey because it shows how narritavely this makes sense at the start of the st movie we see a kid who is treated like crap by everyone in his life aquaintences strangers alike his life is miserable he can t win in any part of life and then he gets his powers like anyone would react if they got powers he s filled with excitement loving this new ability he finally feels like he can catch a break now but he s still a guy who s been bit a lot throughout life so when he finally decides to bite back at one of the many pricks in life in the event when he allows the prick who cheated him out of three grand to get robbed the bite comes back to knaw at him with uncle ben s death between that choice the life lesson uncle ben left for him itself he s now taking up the responsibility of being a hero however he now has a city that hates him and by the end of the film he s left with a strain on his relationships between harry who now unknowingly hates him and mj who loves him but he must turn down he has not yet found that proper balance in life cut to spider man we still see all this disharmony as his life is even a bigger struggle he struggles to balance work school life rent friends love family guilt all while being spider man all while people still resenting spider man so when the time comes where he decides to hang up the hero life he starts to find the rhythmy balance with life in some spots however he nows sees it s too little too late in terms of harry mj on top of all that he struggles to have to watch as people he could save are hurt or die everywhere he goes he soon is relieved of his guilt when he tells aunt may the truth but then when he finally becomes spider man again in the final act mj harry both learn that he s spider man by the end of the film mary jane wants him to be able to feel love while being who he is he deserves a break and she s happy to go on this rocky road with him peter has now nearly found that harmony nearly got his life in perfect balance all that remains is harry cut to spider man we have peter talking about how he s now doing well in school his work life is stable he s juggling everything well with spider man who people now love and he s happily in love with mary jane but he still does not have harmony for harry still resents him but after their tussel in which harry nearly dies he loses his memory and that hostility is over peter is releaved even though twistedly it nearly cost harry his life and subconsciencely this might twist peter a slight bit without him realizing it nearly losing his friend has got him everything he s ever wanted he has acheived harmony balance his life is perfect now add onto that him suddenly recieving a key to the city in a parade ceremony praising him it makes sense that he would start to get a little cocky peter is not use to this his life has never been so good not everyone who has a tough life can always be so humble this narratively makes sense for peter but now there s the part of the film that does make me gag everything that is topher grace as andy brock venom his introduction alone is dreadful as we meet a pompis narcissistic douche bag who thinks he s the hottest shit a master of his craft as gwen s father just watches helplessly as his daughter is hanging for his life brock insensitively decides to say oh yeah i m dating your daughter and is taking pictures of her hanging for her life he s only just started to date gwen but states that he s in love with her and acts like it s much more serious than it actually is and only when it s convenient for him he tries to shmooze up to jonah by stating i have a girl who i intend to marry only seconds after flirting with someone else in the office when he talks with gwen a describes their last meet up as that magicial amazing wonderful date we had her response is we had coffee eddy everytime i see this scene i just imagine their date being him just bragging about his camera skills gear the entire time he s taking photos of her going now i mean you look fine now but with this high depth lense oooo you look way better we ccapture every single pore some little spots here there but don t worry i can touch that up in photoshop he tries to weasel his way in to a position he has in no way earned then he frames spider man for a crime just to get a job when peter comes in and confronts brock just because he has the symbiote in his system doesn t mean he s wrong to do what he does brock literally goes please don t make me face the consequences of my actions let me keep this job i stole from you by framing a hero for a crime peter rightfully has to clear spider man s name and rightfully turns brock in peter doesn t even steal gwen she just liked peter and barely dated brock at all then finding out what he s done she rightfully dumps him and goes out with peter brock acts like a total baby and fits about balming peter for everything that s his own fault peter didn t do this to him or turn him into venom brock went into a church to ask god to murder peter parker for him because that s just how big of a narcissistic douche bag he is that s how he gets the symbiote on him when he runs into peter he even talks to god like it s god s honor it s brock sir andrew crock oh like yeah that s supposed to make you more special his line deliveries of ooooo my spider sense is tingling if you know what i m talking about this that snicker and finger nod literally make my throw up he then blames peter for everything but he did all of this to himself he s unsympathetical egotistical mediocre and a jerk who thinks he can ruin anyone s life just to slightly better his own he s what s crap about this film peter s change before the symbiote made sense narratively and mj deviated from her statemnt at the end of the last film this movie isn t crap it s not fantastic either i d say above middling it s enjoyable enough that i can still watch it again still this is my absolute favorite spider man series rosemary harris deserves an oscar for that speech these movies are the heart of spider man that touch beautifully on humanity and even their plans for the th film were absolutely fantastic they even took huge parts of that story and have used them for the tom holland films from the villains to that big surprise during the first movie in the final act only this one would have been done better in the raimi films i highly recommend you look into what their plans were for the th film it s one i still hold out on hope for to this very day,0
i don t think spider man was a bad movie never have,0
best holland worst andrew favorite toby this is not up for debate,1
you hit the nail on the head with that ending amazing video for an amazing character,0
,0
idk,0
the most spectacular spider man of them all,0
just curious do you think we could ever get a manga collection video,0
hell yeah what a great take on the raimiverse,0
thor once said that spiderman was the most midgardian being and that was a good thing,0
andrew is such a perfect spiderman wish people would drop the nostalgia and see it he wasn t a hot pretty boy type at all still stayed true to the nerd outcast guy was perfect in the suit,1
damn mono audio my right side is broken xd,0
i cried watching this video like times so emotional its incredible amazing video mark truly,0
good ass commercial dude,0
finally a good and just review of the third film the reason why i think the peoples that grew up with the films hated the third was the reasons you mentionned but mostly of nostalgie and so a bias no matter how you look at it the fans of the first two films are biased even in the slighest way but to be frank it really doesn t matter to me after all i am biased too biased towards the third film as a kid it was the only one i saw or that i remembered and i loved and still love it to this day with a burning passion i am proud of saying the third film is my favorite of the trilogy a similar thing happened to me actually where i had it on a cd and i watched it so many times that it was unreadable the birth of sandman scene always makes me cry one of the best made scene of cinema for me ever the first time peter takes the black suit always gives me chills down my spine when the music drop the reflection the dark city ambiance the venom symbiote even thought edie in venom wasn t the best visually the symbiote without host is for me actually the most terrifying form of venom we ever got in spiderman media i truly cannot say how much i am gratefull i wish i posted this comment sooner so that you could have seen it but i can now rest in peace as a spiderman fan my favorite superhero juste like you that my favorite review youtuber made a video about these films and said something great about the third one take that schafrillas productions saying these films aren t really good also my favorite spiderman movie of all time will always be spiderman into the spider verse,0
fucken loved the video g,0
tom holland is the best i m a baby i don t care what you say toby fucking sucks,0
tom holland is the best i m a baby i don t care what you say toby fucking sucks,0
at the end of your review of all the spiderman movies you should do a ranking of them,0
honestly i just wanted to say thank you for making this video mark this trilogy means so much to me in ways you couldn t possibly imagine i ve loved these movies all my life and i think you ve done them justice in the most spectacular way possible amazing amazing job mark thank you,1
i never understood why tf that butler never told him before,0
i agree with the fact that spider man should be able to ko doc oc in one hit but even though it s not focused on that s always been a big thing especially in the comics one in particular is superior spider man where doc oc himself takes spider man s body and comments on how strong he really is and how amazing it is that he s always holding that strength back i ve always loved that,0
peter vs harry is still one of my favorite superhero action scenes ever the fights in these raimi movies really are something else,0
best spiderman is yuri lowenthal but if we re going by movies then it s shameik moore,0
all this and he never spoke about how danny elfman crafted of the greatest film scores in cinematic history,0
im exited to see tobey willem and alfred again in no way home but at the same time im afraid that disney will ruin their characters,0
i honestly love this trilogy i do remember thinking there were way to many villains in movie but i still really like it maybe just take out venom but they re all hilarious and the first one is my third favorite spider man movie,0
have an urge to hookup my vhs player and rewatch this trilogy,0
i appreciate this review but i can not stand mary jane in these movies,0
you cannot just nock doc ock out the arms are keep him concious since they are controlling his brain,1
i lost my father yesterday after years fighting a cancer the part about the hero in all of us made me think about how he was a hero to me just because the fight which he fought with a smile in his face and in a full circle my first gift to him was a piece of paper saying dad you are my hero thanks mark from the bottom of my heart,1
top best trilogys ever just rewatched cried like a female dog r i p best friend see you in the room,0
brilliant work mark as always,0
yo mark i know you re a busy guy and probably get lots of requests but is there a chance you ll review jojo part now that the anime is out,0
tobey is just the best spidey hands down,1
you too can become a hero,0
i m starting to feel guilty for having this youtube channel for free lol,1
idk you as a person i dont say this as a fanboy i truly believe that we are all part of one race the human race thus we are all family thus your pain i empathize with it and im sorry for your loss im happy your dad is better stay steady mark your journey is a great one and we support you,1
just took the time to say that at minutes i thought to myself is he gonna review all three movies and then saw the video goes for more minutes and i smiled from ear to ear thank you mark and thank you team behind this project love yall,1
in the comics its said that pete basically holds back all his power win punching normal humans so to not give them brain damage,1
hold the hell up you can t just put out that god tier g fuel commercial and then go on talking about spider man like it s no big deal we need a whole video of at least you talking about making that,1
oh my god yes i really dislike the use of faceshells i dont like how seamless and perfect the suits look spidey is usually slammed on for wearing spandex but i think its so cool i remember seeing the set photos of toms suit for homecoming and was so happy to see he wasnt wearing one but then they cgid the whole thing the movies always kinda miss certain things that are hammered in the comics that his suit is cloth and requires constant maintenance that its a piece suit with seperated pants and shirt to allow him to wear it under his clothes and that he needs to take off his shoes to crawl on walls tasm was close though i liked that the zippers were visible he does remove the shirt portion in a clip and they show his mask has the face shell built in it which was cool,1
it bothers me a bit that mark referred to this trilogy as incredible spectacular and iconic instead of amazing spectacular and sensational,1
thank you for the review mark i just lost my own grandmother and have similarly spent quite a bit of time lately struggling with the concept and meaning of mortality that you found your answer in aunt may s words is a relief that all we can do with our time is love and possibly even inspire others to be there for each other and that s the heroic ideal anyone really can wear the mask after all,1
i love this naruto ark,1
man all i m going to say of this review is the nostalgia is powerful on how people see this film tobey is an awful peter the villain is cheesy over acting and incredibly hard to take seriously and good lord mj s actress is just the worst a literal dead fish would be a better choice but the way you talk about it man i don t think anyone that grew with it can see it they just see the memes and convince themselves that it was a good thing because they grew up with it also that if you mess with one of us scene is stupid as balls the character presented in this film this green goblin would just toss a bomb to those idiots but no because we need a feel good moment am actually did this scene well with the construction workers doing what they can with their gear to lend a hand and of course with captain stacy,0
autn may looking kinda evil with those green reflections on her glasses,0
bro you made me cry with that take on aunt may un spiderman,1
this is awesome i think the way you talk about these movies are some of the best i ve seen and you can definetly feel the passion i think you should review the mcu kinda like how you review your animes,1
uuuuuuh the time has come also andrew garfield is best spiderman and holland the worst and not because holland do a bad portrait but because his films sucks spider balls,1
i hope this includes the mtv cgi spin off series it was really good,1
great video,1
good video,1
enter doctor otto octavius if i were a rich man,1
yeah spiderman pulls his punches all the time in the comic when doc ock took over peters body he accidently punched off the scorpions jaw which revealed to otto just how much peter holds back which is spidermans weakness he has sever guilt he holds back because he killed the man who killed his uncle the pain of killing forces him to never punch at even th power i think the only marvel character stronger than spiderman is the hulk and thats just barely the real plot hole or whatever isnt why couldnt spiderman knock out doc ock in one hit its why didnt venom spiderman explode mary jane after hitting her since he had a x multiplier to his attack,0
so about the spiderman s strength nitpick i think the explanation of this is that his strength while punching is not the same as his durability he probably punches a bit stronger than a normal human but his body is able to withstand greater forces pushing or pulling on it,1
never in my life have i needed something so much and never known until i recieved it tfs vegeta,1
though tobi is the best they all have qualities of spider man which others didn t have,0
great video mark you got me looking forward to thursdays now,0
man just imagine how many masterpieces sam raimy would have made with spiderman if sony didn t force things into his plans we would had spider man and fuck you sony,0
aunt may is the heart of these series spiderman is a masterpiece,0
i love that otto seems to act on baser instincts when relying on the arms the singular goal that he has been chasing before the accident is the one thing that rewards his brain how he can t seem to fully grasp peter as spider man in the climax but doesn t seem entirely surprised his higher brain has it figured out but his instinct hasn t made the connection between the thing preventing him from his goal and the responsible hero in spider man otto is clearly incredibly intelligent but the arms are feeding the input of his lowest instincts back into him muddling his morality and ethics,1
i loved andrew garfield as spider man the one odd issue i had with him was he wasn t nerdy he was a hot guy poorly dressed acting as a nerd toby had the whole nerd thing down more while tom has the whole inexperienced hero teenager thing down better,0
i may not completely agree with a lot of the points made in this video but spider man has meant a lot to everyone and i feel you really captured your personal experience in this a legacy that has helped so many in such difficult times that is at the core of the character,0
this man is defending spider man,0
great video,0
watching this video series right after watching the cosmonaut variety hour s review of spider man is hilarious talk about completely different viewpoints,0
yes the new york city citizen dialogue is horky and corny thats not what we actually sound like or anything hahaha,0
gfuel ad was hilarious,0
mark got bored so we are doing something else,0
is extremely underrated and my favorite one,0
while i somewhat agree spider man is ludicrously powerful which is why he has to restrain himself so much his strength is comparable to characters like hulk mostly the weaker versions but a hulk is a hulk in most of spider man s fights he tangos with super powered humans as opposed to super humans so dock ock isnt going to survive hits aimed for the rhino you also have to consider that lifting strength and punching strength aren t exactly the same thing nitpick of a nitpick aside i loved this vid cant wait for the next one,0
venom is an alien how else are they going to bring him in without a space rock,0
i recall one thing that stuck with me in the first movie when i watched it as a kid is when the green goblin pleaded for his life saying that the goblin persona was taking over his actions only for him to change his voice and facial expression before accidentally killing himself i think this was one of the first times i realized that some mental issue could affect the behavior of someone kinda like anger or joy or laughter and though i knew it was a movie it that part didn t feel like not real really powerful stuff to kid me it s likely why the new goblin ended up becoming my favorite villain overall in this trilogy mostly because harry is a very conflicted character mentally and physically and that all his deadly gadgets can represent something to fear but also something to hope for especially that one grenade that hits the sandman when he shows up for his last rescue in contrast with the way it first appeared in the first movie point is i actually loved the third movie as a kid and i still do now glad someone else managed to enjoy it too two was still my favorite tho but eh i didn t seem to like to compare things much i just classified em in different categories also that was the best g fuel ad yet period xd,0
i respect marks opinions on but man i would ve loved hearing his thoughts on the film had sony avi arad not interfered with sam rami s original vision i know for a fact he would ve loved harry s original story originally rami wanted harry to be conflicted about killing his best friend and be somewhere in the middle also his butler was originally supposed to be a figment of harry s imagination representing denial of who his father was and what his father did,0
my film ratings for this trilogy spider man spider man spider man note i don t give out or easily so this is some crazy high score for movies with a main actor i didn t like the narrative carried this movie,0
absolutely incredible work on such an iconic piece of cinema,0
this vid did a really good job of highlighting why i liked the rami movies as much as i used to also just really well edited scripted and presented great work everyone,0
spider kino,0
i only know about spiderman through and amazing spiderman and movies didn t realize there were more than,0
spider man is thematically beautiful but narratively confused,0
this is such a masterpiece of a youtube video i love you man i appreciate your content more than i can say you have taught me some things i would ve never learned by myself you have taught me life lessons and helped me to grow up and go into my freshman year of college knowing what i wanted to do with my life i pray for you brother thank you,1
algorithm comment good video,0
my right ear is very pleased with those first spider man movie scenes lol,0
in the comics doc oc takes over peter s body he punches some guy and his head comes clean off that s conformation that spiderman always pulls his punches,0
coming back to these as an older person some of the scenes that i enjoyed the most were with just peter and his every day struggles as a kid the spiderman parts were what hooked me while the other scenes were pushed aside but now some of my favorite scenes are of peter without the mask this video was able to sum up most reasons why i love these movies it may be one of my favorite trilogies and hosts my favorite spiderman pulled off exceptionally by tobey maguire so thank you for making this video and i can t wait to see what you have to say on marc webs spiderman,1
what s funny about is that in the comics doc oc actually becomes spider man and he realizes just how much peter pulls his punches and that if peter wanted to kill him he could ve been killed him,1
this was absolutely amazing,0
you are getting better and better at this like the part where you re talking about the costume i was huffing like a fanboy until you explained you had a take i personally never heard of or thought about really besides when they added the animation to deadpool s eyes,0
i want the finale of this series to be spider verse but it s not live action films so i guess not,1
i feel like the complaints about the mask shape are pretty nit picky,0
holy crap i didn t know they got lucy lawless in there makes sense sam raimi but man definitely didn t notice that before now,1
tnm please add a tan lee counter to the graphic,0
on december th i lost my mother to congestive heart failure that hit me harder than anything else i ve been in numerous car wrecks suffered many heart breaks and have lost loved ones before i only just in the last few months started to get to a point where i can talk about things it s made me very sensitive to hearing about someone whether it be a person i know irl or a person on the internet losing a loved one i m sorry for your loss mark i bet she d be very proud of you,1
this is my favourite spider man,1
that vote is nostalgia talking tom is easily the best spiderman,0
the old man popping up is stan lee in case you don t know,0
that soundtrack tho,0
shoutout to another great video,0
the thing is toby was the best peter parker andrew was the best spider man and tom is the best of both worlds,0
eyes like that are a symptom of extreme stress or trauma,0
i paused the video just to say holy shit that was my favorite gfuel ad yet i hate energy drinks but damn these ads about to make me buy out the store just to have them sit in my room and never be touched,0
i re watched spiderman literally a hour before this review dropped and i shed a tear at how much better the movie was then i remembered,1
wut u mean by dat,0
i wanna know what peter did to make everyone in his school despise him so much they wouldnt let him sit by them on the bus,0
now i see oda copied spiderman peter couldnt punch sandman logia until he got the haki black alien suit im joking oda takes inspiration from everywere to make goat master piece one piece,0
you re going to make me cry man cmon,0
that iron giant line hit waaaaaaaaay to much,0
started rewatching all the spider man movies in prep for nwh gonna watch the nd raimi movie tonight,0
don t care what anyone says spider man is still a great movie and my favorite of the spider man movies,0
i ve heard it put as follows tobey is the best peter parker andrew is the best spider man tom is the best blend,0
the mask being expressionless is a good fit for a superhero identity he is something more than human and the moments we see behind the mask torn to shreds seeing the humanity underneath are punctuated because of it not only is it a symbolic way to create tension and emotion but it highlights the fundamental message of having dual identities,0
where s your usual close i look forward to and believe it to when you say thank you so much for watching,0
i think that s why i like spider man ps outside of just enjoying the gameplay it has a similar setup to the first raimi film doc oct being a father like figure before trying to manipulate him during the climax of the story,0
c mon we all know the true star actor was joel mchale,0
so to get the answer to how much spidey pull its punches he can carry up to tons let that sink in yeah at every point in fight except certain super villians and more in the super side he has to pull his punches a lot or he will end up killing them unless its been retconed like other things this not only apply to his punches but actually much more else when villians without super exoskeleton enhancing suits or naturally super he bends his body to recive the punches cause otherwise it would be like them hitting an iron beam so yeah spidey holds back a lot for the sake of not killing in fact his deadliest power is actually his wall crawling so powerful he doesnt use it to attack how strong he has ripped apart an irom suit with it,0
your opinion on the suit is silly,0
the most obvious title for spider man and keeping in line with the home theme and likely hood that spider man will by the end of no way home start to have a turn around with the public z coming back to being a hero in their eyes and clearing his name spiderman homeward bound it s perfect,0
for the sam raimi movies they are my favorite spider man movies even today i dont mind watching them even if some parts are cringey my wife and friends have different opinions with andrew garfield or tom holland being better it is their opinion but this video shows just how great they are and how much i love them i think that the two other spider man we have had since just dont feel the same tobey and sam raimi did great with the stories i hope that we get to see tobey as spider man again,0
what an idiotic take with spider man not knocking out otto please read some more comics for fucks sake he pulls his punches to the point where he won t obliterate his target would we rather have a movie where he one shots doc oc come on and plot falling from the sky it is a spider man movie how is venom your favorite villain but you don t know anything about the symbiote it does not make sense the things you say just do not make sense you praise the camp feel of the movies then shit on comic book accurate lore,0
yeeeesss i have been waiting for this,0
you can say whatever you want about the suit or the mask not being able to show emotion limiting the use of the character and actor and taking away from a scene or two but the fact is that the mask makes scenes in which spider man takes it off deeper than if he were to wear a thinner mask or no mask at all for most of the movie,1
just gonna pause the video mid review to say thank you for putting in the mvc spider man theme,0
i love how you manage to see the good things in an even better way than i myself saw this is an amazing video mark,0
hi mark you likely won t see this but i wanted you to know this work you are doing has been among other things to make me feel better in my life i lost my father earlier this year very suddenly and i was unable to be there with him due to lock downs i then lost my grandfather a few weeks ago it was sudden i hope you are doing well thank you,0
this exact thing happened to me sometimes i still have some panic attacks but i m learning to deal with it,0
i literally just watched spider man yesterday and i m currently watching the third film i was debating with my friends i think the way sam raimi portrayed spider man was superb tobey really felt like a spider man the organic web shoots his spider crawling his spider like mannerisms even the spider senses is portrayed brilliantly in all three films the way the fights were choreographed and how the movie was capture was ahead of its time spider man felt real whereas mcu spider man although probably the best portrayal doesn t feel spider like tom holland s spider man feels like iron man jr tobey maguire felt independent whereas tom holland feels too dependent i need tom holland to feel more like his own entity and not relying on the help of strange iron man etc i think in his nd trilogy he ll start to be more independent i love tobey maguire that s how i was introduced to spider man but tom holland is authentic he s the future tobey maguire forever,1
iconic is right it turned out one of the best ways to have a superhero movie based off of spider powers thrive in a non superhero movie consumed early s was to hire a horror director and danny elfman to do the music is it hammy yeah dated definitely but considering there was no avengers no expanded universe or guarantees it was masterful in holding its own and building to more the music though is underrated the horns when he first climbs the walls the percussion at the start of the opening credits even the quiet moments are amazing from elfman and then raimi gives you jump scares and horror scenes to sell the danger of the villains build suspense and tension tobey for me embodies peter parker in the perfect way in being goofy nerdy and humble even spider man which everyone seems to misunderstand that the dancing is meant to be cringey we see how vindictive he can be when pushed by overinflated self esteem and harris was perfect as a comic accurate aunt may too keeping us guessing on whether she knows or not then you have brilliant villains in dafoe molina and church each in their own way tragic in their descent downfall and obsession not to mention acted brilliantly and j jonah jameson one of the most perfect castings in superhero movies still to this day na na you don t wanna talk to bruce campbell s character that dude is mysterio that ad was surprisingly motivating too spider man still battles with into the spider verse for my favourite spidey movie they both manage to bring out the best of their characters for sm it was peter feeling the weight of his responsibility even though it isn t helping his personal life at all a crisis of character between peter and octavius as for well it s not as bad as people have made a mandela it s more not as good as the others it still holds up well but you can feel that this wasn t the same enthusiasm raimi had for the other two venom btw my favourite was kraven and i am still waiting as a side act with that lowkey sexual assault allegory and the amnesia arc felt like tv episode stories compared to planned ideas like lizard vulture and mysterio lamenting on the what could ve been aside the film had some really good scenes in it the reasons you love spider man is why this trilogy thrives because it understood that as the selling point and technically still does in later films,0
mark could you drop some insight as to how you have such a good understanding of film analysis and story structure,0
for me andrew garfield s peter parker spider man didn t have the selfless feel about him it never really felt like he was continually struggling to make the right choice for the citizens of ny or the people he loved the choice to use his power to help everyone else at the cost of stability in his own life so much as it felt like he saw a bad guy and was the only person he knew who could stop them his deciding to become spider man almost felt a bit to me like a convenient way to test out and practice his powers in a way that helps people instead of out of a desire to actually use his powers to help those people his repeatedly dunking on the car thief while apprehending him definitely felt that way as it showed no empathy whatsoever he even promised the police chief that he wouldn t date gwen in order to keep her safe and then reneged on that promise like two scenes later immediately before the end of the movie and there was the flash basketball scene in which he completely humiliated flash even though flash was a bully and didn t really reflect on himself becoming the bully in that situation unless i m forgetting that part of the movie revenge on a bully only creates another bully and that s one of the reasons why i really like the idea that j jonah jameson turns ny against spidey in the raimi trilogy he continually chooses to sacrifice for them despite them not understanding what he does for them tobey maguire s peter parker feels the impact of not following uncle ben s advice right at the beginning of the first movie because he was angry and chose not to use his powers in a moment that probably would have constituted responsible use ben died and knowing that making the same decision in the future could indirectly cause others to suffer he decides to embody ben s wisdom and that decision does not come without more suffering the entire second movie highlights the poverty failing academics struggling relationships and other difficult things that come from silently taking on that kind of responsibility to the point where peter just decides to hang up the mantle because he can t take it anymore but he eventually realizes that someone has to protect others from doc ock and he is the one capable of that and then the third movie tackles that same stuff from another angle he struggles with feelings of vengeance against ben s perceived killer and anger toward harry mj brock and jjj and as a result he embraces a dark side of those emotions that ends up becoming dangerous to him and others venom wasn t even needed for those emotions to be brought to the surface within peter but it was a convenient way to include the villain and highlight those struggles and it was a good way to show the impact of the choice peter made to not lean into those temptations further though the suit gave him power and supposedly improved his life in various ways he ultimately made the decision to do what was best for others and shed it i almost feel like garfield s peter would have continued wearing the suit because of the ways that it seemingly improved his life until he either hit rock bottom and had no other choice or until some scientist told him that it was a vicious alien that was trying to conquer the world or something not because shedding it would be the right thing for others however i could just be misremembering the tone of garfield s character that the movies put out i haven t seen them in quite a long while but that s the impression that i had when i used to watch them,1
you don t have the nitpick about the really cool part where he s thrown forward weaves through the walkway and then somehow is behind doc ock and surprised him,0
i m minutes in and just wondering why is it that the movie sounds voices and so on only come from the right channel marks voice is in stereo but in movie dialogue just doesn t love both ears equally,0
true,0
lol reviewing every just the tobey ones lmao,0
yes this is simply the best way to look at the trilogy,0
i never liked spider man maybe i need to rewatch it because i always thought this was a boring movie and doc oc pales in comparison with the green goblin from the first movie,0
holy crap i wasn t expecting to cry from that,1
i came here for a nostalgia trip and got met with a gut punch in the feels how do i report a video for making me emotional,0
incredible ad,0
with regards to masks helmets something i ve noticed with my journeys through kamen rider just started blade is that there is a lot to convey with the movement of the body in place of facial expressions,0
mark watches hitop too,0
my favourite spiderman is probably andrew garfield my favourite peter parker is tobey maguire tom holland is solid at both though and is my second favourite peter parker and spiderman,0
can t wait to see the rest of these this was a great review thought i was the only one that actually enjoyed spider man,0
out of all videos you ve ever done as a huge fan of spiderman ima bench watch this without sleep eat doing homework nor bathroom breaks,0
amazing video would love to see mark do a review series of the mcu films,0
you defy my logic and i defy yours if they had decided to focus on venom then i think this quote would define them completely venom who is from space and by default has a completely different nature from everyone on earth from the way he views things to what he is capable of it s why i loved venom s ability to grab the sandman despite the fact that he should ve crumbled at his fingertips it was so cool that he defied logic because he was an alien an unknown entity venom is literally built different and because of that he brings new options the option to properly kill sandman instead of trapping him not only that but the various new ways he could make pretty much anything easier i like to look at the newest interpretation of venom spiderman when i use this line in spider s shadow which is a what if about spiderman keeping the venom symbiote it portrays their relationship as two variations of the same morals like how they did with otto venom finds fulfillment in being a hero and that is what he wants to be but when going through peter s thoughts he finds that it may be easier to just eliminate the threat to take the easy way out and do things quickly peter goes against this and slowly gives in before finally coming to his senses what i didn t like about it was that venom was just blamed for everything and is hated for presumably corrupting everyone which isn t exactly wrong but it isn t right either a symbiote takes on the traits of everyone it bonds with and as such becomes the accumulation of everyone he meets you can even feel some of the remorse from venom especially when he starts to say sorry to peter even if it s only for an instant like a child learning and interacting with others if spiderman was about accepting responsibility and spiderman was about dealing with responsibility along with it s consequences then number should have been about teaching responsibility to show the everyone and more importantly to show the character venom that there are alternatives that they can find a solution and face the never ending battle together to show venom that all life deserves a second chance no matter what form it takes on or how they wronged you to have spiderman become the mentor of sorts so when venom finally moves on he can spread good nature somewhere else regardless if it s on earth or out in space to find out where the story ends,1
completely hit me outta left field with this video but fuck yeah let s go let s talk about some spiderman,0
goodness that gfuel ad,0
this video made me smile,0
you know i really was looking forward to this video and i m genuinely happy the way it turned out i ve been watching the sam rami trilogy since i was or just knowing that there is someone out there who appreciates them as much as i do makes me really happy spider man is my favorite hero as well good job and i m looking forward to the next videos on the other spider man movies,0
love your video,0
this is so beautiful mark also while tobey s and the animated spiderman were my first exposure to our friendly neighborhood andrew garfield made spidey mu favorite i m so excited to hear your take on tasm,1
my spider senses are thinglying,0
damn it mark i teared up so much watching this video when you talked about the hero in all of us,0
i wonder if any one in this comment section saw evil dead evil dead and army of darkness,1
this review like wow holy crap wow,0
you are my favourite youtuber of all time perfect review i mean it,0
love it couldn t help but cry at some parts gj all involved,0
the fact that spider man pulls his punches is actually addressed in the comics specifically the superior spider man comics where doc oc takes over spider mans body and kills the vulture in one punch,0
i like spider man too great movie just with a bit dated but still great,0
does anyone else s suddenly wanna but some gfuel,0
you should watch the spectacular spider man animated series it s much better than most live action spider man movies,1
rosemary harris performance is the best aunt may in live action spiderman i cried at her performance in the trilogy especially in because she s what peter s needs to protect and the only family he has besides his friends,1
i think what i love about this video is that it gave me a new perspective on both mary jane and spider man excellent video,0
headphone users just checked their headphones here,0
the most important development in my taste of movies in the past few years is that spider man is good actually but maybe that s just because the marvel movies we ve gotten for a while have been mostly emotionally hollow basically the only thing i don t like about it is harry getting amnesia but i still think he s a better villain than the vast majority of cbm villains we ve gotten since it came out in if venom wasn t forced into it by sony avi arad i have complete faith that it would be talked about as one of the best comic book movies ever made,0
people are really unwilling to talk about these movies critically and honestly it s a little disappointing,0
with spider man probably being my favorite superhero i m really glad that i got to grow up watching this trilogy seeing these movies again really help me to understand just how much i value the character as well as any superhero or other properties i enjoyed from my younger days,1
spectacular video mark i love your channel man i m and i was given every issue of the original comic series by my dad like years ago and i read them all the time,0
as someone who routinely power scales anime there is a big difference between punching strength and lifting strength superman for example superman can lift and or move planets but not every one of his punches is gonna blow up a planet,1
i wasn t expecting much of your spidey videos but i sticked because your thing to tell stories this is your best video so far and i love how contagious your enthusiasm is my condolences for your loss,0
vine buscando cobre y encontr oro alv,0
ok i know what i am about to suggest isn t a movie or a series but i d really enjoy if you could see the story of marvel s spider man for the ps then remastered for ps because that game really as a nice story perhaps not as good as the raimi story but good non the less with an older peter and a small side story to boot that takes on a new spider man and gives him time to shine not just any character a character that at one point wasn t liked in the comics at all and just like spiderverse makes us love that character also,0
can i suggest one rewrite for spider man that i think may have improved it and incorporated venom as a villain better have the symbiote latch on to harry instead during the third act that way it becomes about two characters bith wanting to avenge their fathers one is corrupted by it to the point it causes his death whilst the other learns to forgive and has to move on with his life peter and eddie didn t have enough of a rivalry for their fight to matter whereas harry vs peter would have had this great anakin vs obi wan epic feel to it,0
my favorite spider man will always be josh keaton,0
the mask thing always did bother me a bit like he s yelling at goblin but you don t see his jaw move but he still does look cool most of the time,0
some of your best work,0
true tobey is the best despite the popular resistance to his casting at the time the movies were made he proved all dissenters wrong in his poignant performance have yet to sit through let alone will never finish the remakes because why bother raimi and elfman were the perfect pair to bring spidey to life rewatchable too the epitome of good films great review this ta,0
hey bb love the vid and have been looking foward to it just a thought this ended up popping up in my feed and i skipped it a few times because the tumbnail didn t look like your content wasn t until i saw that beautiful lil tnm name that i knew this was going to be quality peace and love great vid,0
also when it comes to his super strength feats i believe that those scenes in particular have him use adrenaline,0
beautiful review i was bummed we weren t getting naruto this month but after this vid highlights being mark s personal family moments and the idea of choice i think this is one of his best vids thus far,1
it s not much but a lot of the talking and expression issues under the mask can easily be fixed by adding more head movements and hand gestures to bring the point across with suits like these the actors need to move in really exaggerated ways to convey emotion it may sound cheesy and a lot like power rangers but that s the point i mean there wouldn t be power rangers without spider man in the first place,0
is that phil lamarr,0
i ve never imagined someone who likes or even praises the bar scene,0
i get what you re saying about the mask helmet and though it is too disguise his identity it has also been said that he wears it to hide his fear his mask and quips come from fear and nervousness so to that extent not being able to see his expressions is on point but i do agree that cinematically it does hinder us some from seeing his performance but in the scene where goblin is presenting the choice between mj and the kids spider man s body language tells us everything we need to know about what he s experiencing internally that s good acting,0
i feel like i m one of the few people who saw this movie as a kid and didn t immediately hate it,0
garfield was good i enjoyed those movies i never got the hate,0
mark got a phone call,0
thanks for remidning me what s missing from superhero movies today,0
mark should also cover the venom movies once he gets through the variations of spider man,1
hey mark you know you gotta do spiderman ps s story now that you used that theme music,1
wow new york crowds do remind me a bit of one piece s citizen crowds for example nami s home town or dressrosa so sweet,0
i m not even gonna cap your words and how you describe these scenes especially when talking about the hero within all of us and the struggles of trying to keep moving forward choked me up peter barley being able to save the train and passing out after to have the new yorkers save him from falling a beautiful scene no doubt,0
to be perfectly honest i did not expect to enjoy this video as much as i ened up doing,0
i dont know how to send request for you to react to stuff so i will ask here can you react to fairy tail its my favorite anime so far not just because of the story but because of the emotions and the lessons every time im down i find stuff about it and i feel better,0
spiderman is the best movie of its genre hell as it is as it always will be probably imo it s the perfect sequel in every way shape and form and is quite literally timeless,0
the best take i heard about the raimi films is that a lot of the dislike they got was simply an unfortunate symptom of the time the raimi movies were among the first big superhero movies when the supehero genre was still new and struggling to be seen as mature with many still having the mindset of superheroes are just for kids so having the raimi movies be a lot more light hearted and at times somewhat goofey in their presentation made many people believe that they simply weren t what was needed at the time the films were too goofy to childish they weren t the proof they wanted to show the world that superhero movies were the mature pieces of art they wanted them to be seen as so there was a bit of a backlash because of it however now looking back at it with the superhero genre being firmly ingrained into today s society a lot of people can look back and are much more open to appreciate the movies for what they were,0
my right ear enjoyed the spiderman scenes,0
the deadpool movie is a good example on how much emotion can still be seen under a mask and how much it can impact a character even if cartoonish it adds so much to every impact on the character,0
i started watching this video when it was at views i finished it and it had views this video deserved more than a million by the time i finished it or i might just be too early,0
beautiful,0
i never watched the other spiderman because to me tobey was the only true spiderman in movies,0
mark thank you i was rewatching all the spider man movies in the lead up to no way home and i really did enjoy seeing the raimi movies but this video opened my eyes to how much was going on theme wise and i have an even deeper respect for them now thank you again and i can t wait for your videos on garfield and holland,0
you know what would ve been fucking cool since doc ock was being controlled by his arms at least partially he could ve been avoiding every single one of peter s i m trying to knock you out punches being carried by his arms like a puppet to avoid every hit until one of them lands just the first punch leaves him unconscious and then the arms keep dodging and fighting carrying this unconscious man while they fight spider man until he eventually regains conscience i m basically saying temporary zombie doc ock or robotic guys carrying a passed out dude,0
i swear spider man would have been better if eddie brock didn t exist and harry got the venom symbiote at the church instead then the movie is about peter needing to let of his hatred for flint marko killing ben while harry becomes peter s antithesis not letting go of his hatred for thinking peter killed norman the movie ends with peter and harry teaming up to fight the symbiote the thing that fed both their hatred it s like poetry it rhymes,0
is he going to do spider verse too please tell me he does spider verse,1
the feels man the feels,0
i still prefer tom holland,1
god fucking damn what a great video,0
the incredible the spectacular the iconic you know you now legally have to open the andrew garfield movies by adding amazing right,0
love that mark is incorporating the irish tv advertising ways into this g fuel ad,0
i disagree there is too many villains in this movie it s name is venom the movie would have worked better if venom never appeared in it just the suit,0
i ve never agreed so hard with opinions till i watched this great work mark it s nice to see someone really dive into what makes peter parker spider man can t wait for the next videos,0
i can t wait for the far from home review i didn t like it but maybe mark s breakdown will shine some new light on it,0
tobey the best spider man,1
absolutely fantastic review man i love the fact that the holy trilogy is still so iconic and important for so many people my fav films by far nice job,1
dude i watched this movies s much that i decorated the script i knew every line when some ost play i knew what scene were i think i was obsessed just a liitle,0
i haven t watched spider man since it was in theaters back in the day the first news i heard when i turned my cell phone on after the movie was from my aunt who is a nurse that my childhood friend was killed when a train struck his truck i enjoyed the movie itself but i can t help but associate it with those negative feelings i felt afterwards,0
personally i prefer tom holland s spider man but spider man is the best spider man film in my opinion i rewatched it thinking it was over hyped but man i cried when peter repeated aunt may s steady speech,0
not fair mark ending with the stan lee quote,0
ayyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mark is a weekly wackididoo always nice to see a shout out to mr sunday movies,0
this ad definitely makes me wanna buy gfuel but can people also get a real sugar option too i hate alternative sugars and the taste it comes with otherwise i d buy gfuel instantly,0
this is my childhood,0
nice ted lasso reference,0
tobey maguire s spider man and spider man ps has the best heroic score they really help to create an uplifting scene,1
loved the raimi trilogy but tobey wasn t even close to being an accurate spider man nor an accurate peter parker he represented the raw heroism of the character pretty well but nothing more,0
mark will you believe me if i tell you that i almost crying for this video the love you put not only in the work but for this character and this incarnation are inspiring keep it up,0
i loved the raimi trilogy but tobey wasn t even close to being an accurate spider man nor an accurate peter parker,0
do star wars,0
i loved the raimi trilogy but tobey wasn t even close to being an accurate spider man nor an accurate peter parker,0
great video,0
i loved your review but i have to disagree with you about the mask part so many great games for excample samus master chief even doom guy to an extend express themselves masterfully with body language not needing a face to express themselves i get how talking sections can feel odd about it but it s a drawback im favour for allowing him as in many of his comics to show the focus of their body language,0
this review was would have been a perfect if you ended with hero by chad kroger still good stuff i m sorry to hear about the trials you ve faced these last two years it s clich but heroes really do inspire people more than we realize,0
that gfuel commercial was freaking great,0
i m gonna bring this up now before it happens but i think andrew garfield does a good job capturing the confidence cockiness and more fun personality peter has as spiderman,1
totally not mark reviewing one of my childhood s favorite movies yes please c also dangit these g fuel ads are incredible,0
no love for garfield,0
i understand you dislike of the costume s muting of emoting but i don t know if i totally agree his blank appearing expression can be used quite well when the audience knows the state of mind and emotion the character is feeling but trying to hide with the mask maybe my issue is that masks haven t been used very well for a very long time in cinema it used to be a useful tool in the hands of a director to allow the character to mirror the audience but i ve lost faith in our current crop of hollywood directors who seem to feel the need to state to the audience what to feel or pay attention to rather than setting the scene up for them to naturally reach that conclusion and when you tell the audience what to feel mirroring doesn t work,0
been waiting for this,0
i will say thing that venom did very well in the tobey trilogy was the symbiotes movments not the two legged venom the symbiote the way it looks as if its crawling and stretching forwards using itself as claws to climb works better than how the venom movie just have the symbiote glides and squirms across the floor like slime it dosent fail but it definitely makes venom feel like a suit instead of a creature also let me just say i m suprised i didn t hear any praise about the music goblins theme was so wild and chaotic doc ock s theme powerful and menacing the balck suit s theme up roaring and yet with a smoldering evil behind it,0
beautiful video mark can t wait for the next ones,0
toby maguire is spiderman,0
let s be honest we re all here for toby myles andrew and tom who cares,0
this is an amazing piece of content mark hat s off to you still there is one nitpick about the train fight yeah the first spiderman has pulled off some amazing feats of strength however never directly against an enemy sam rami s spiderman is haunted by the specter of responsibility it can be inferred that he is terrified of using his full strength against another human until mentally pushed past his inhibitions he fights to check never to maim or kill in theory there are so many ways he could win against doc oc but it would be like batman using a gun,1
is it just be or are the movie lines not playing audio is this an editing thing youtube or copyright strike,0
bro if i was in that train crowed surfing spider man when it my turn to carry him i would ve smack is butt lowkey,0
i found rewatching spiderman this year caused me to have a massive epiphany that i needed this year i rewatched it shortly before my rd bday back a few months ago when i was extremely depressed and didn t care if i lived or died i felt like i was in such a low nothing spot of my life i don t have alot of money i had supportive friends who were there but i wasn t always able to with them cuz school and work and financial problems and was dealing with a terrible breakup following an extremely toxic and manipulative relationship and a part of me wanted to forget my responsibilities and take what i thought was an easier path it caused me to have a crisis of my future and a fear of my dreams and my responsibilities i feared what it meant to be a hero and what it meant to be good and watching spiderman and getting to aunt mays hero speech made me realize alot i knew my dreams were turning into a fuck it whatever mindset and it s not right and i was close to going down the same path that someone who hurt me was going down i realized alot of things i wanted weren t what i needed and it brought me to tears as i began remembering what i am and what i want,0
if you guys like this you should check out cosmonaut variety hours vids on the spider man series people say he nitpicks but i thin he made lots of valid points,0
idky but i always love the ed movie in a trilogy stat wars not hate that one spider man lord of the ring return of the king batman forever and batman robin the dark knight rises iron man thor ragnarok captain america civil war avengers infinity war end game indiana jones and the last crusade back to the future part terminator judgment day pirates of the caribbean at worlds end logan matrix revolution honorable mentions toy story which losses to toy story x men the last stand which losses to x men men in black which losses to men in black,0
the critique about the mask is interesting from a film acting perspective but having a form fitting mask on someone s face to see the important features comes off as goofy but the mask doesn t cover one aspect that can come through clearly and that s the voice spider man has always been a guy with a million quips under his belt but also someone who can talk a person down from escalating an issue you don t need to see his mouth to see his humanity,0
as you mentioned about spidey the main theme of peter s struggles is a huge reason why this version of spider man felt real accurate spidey is a hero with the absolute worst luck from relationships to finances to romance and everything in between however he perseveres through all the hardship because he knows it s the right thing to do the other spidey films have not felt like they have really executed on this front nearly as well especially the financial struggles tom holland spidey does not feel like a person who has ever struggled for money,0
incredible video almost speechless and left me extremely emotional thanks for this,1
i m gonna put some dirt in your comments,0
les go one of my favorite franchises,0
this be goated,0
on the subject of peter parker pulling his punches to not kill people you should read superior spiderman if you havent,0
idk about peak except in the second one,1
that was a really good video,0
when you said your sentence about hope and just to survive a second longer at minute it remembered me of a rat experiment where they put rats in a bucket and they drowned after a few minutes the second group got rescued at the last moment when put again into the bucket they hold on for their hero to save them again for several days and dont succumb to despair and drowned totally exhausted some experiments are cruel,0
i actually just rewatched all movies last week and yeah you were able to put into words what i couldn t about aunt may s speech brought me to tears love your videos man,1
can t wait for arcane review arcane,0
you should review the playstation game at some point cause the actual best spider man is yuri lowenthal from the ps game,0
i think the mask being a limiting factor for conveying emotion is usually used to the writers advantage in the climax of spider man stories there s a reason why it s so common for them to remove or tear peter s mask in the most important battles of a lot of spider man media after all the most compelling aspect of the hero is the struggle of the man behind the mask we get used to see spider man show emotion the best way he can through the mask but when that is removed the impact is much greater and even more so if the person he s fighting is either someone peter is attached to or someone he hates the mask is a limiting factor but in a certain way it can also be used as an advantage,1
i really agree and relate to what you felt about being scared to die mark that same feeling and anxiousness gripped during the pandemic too and i would have a lot of panic attacks too what helped me was reading kingdom seeing these amazing characters being so close to death and experiencing moments where they really were and still having an amazing dream really made me realize not to worry at all i just have to keep myself in the movement and focus on what i want to do in the time i have still an amazing video mark and i can t wait for the other,0
the reason spider man s punches don t just demolish doc oct is because he pulls his punches when fighting in the comics doc oct hijacked spidey s body at one point and literally punched scorpion s jaw off on accident spidey is basically fighting at like if his actual strength when fighting non super powered humans,0
use this as a mark needs to review into the spiderverse button,1
it kind of felt nice to hear the man tom himself on the ad lol we miss u tom,0
the insomniac theme goes amazingly well with this,0
not even a hot take to claim rosemary s performance is the best out of all love her as aunt may,0
if the next video doesn t include that clip of andrew dressed as spider man doing street tricks for pocket change then there s a missed opportunity,0
la verdad has echo un gran video joven padawan,0
spider man was a cultural icon long before the films,0
review the spiderman ps game please that would be a great video,0
big fan first time commenter love most of your opinions on your page but with the spider man mask i felt like i should ve chimed a lil in although the mask covers all emotions the mask is suppose to do that he wears it so they don t know how scared he is and makes sense in the context in the movie for me because the moment the villain truly knows spideys just a scared teen he loses,0
i hate you i hate this channel why do i cry everytime i come here why do you put things so beautifully goddamn it,0
how come when the movie audio is playing it s only on the right channel that s annoying,0
the editors never fail to amaze me with their hard work,0
what makes me intrigued about raimi s green goblin more than the rest of the villains is that through the whole trilogy he s the only one that isn t actually wrong doc ock was flawed mainly on his plans since the experiment failed venom s personality was leading peter to lose everything he had and even then some without actually getting anything in return beyond self confidence and sandman was doing poor choices with good intentions but norman was right to a certain extend just not the exact way he predicted you see those close to peter looking down on him as the story keeps going you see him losing his life for the sake of others with little to no return which is what makes his decission in sm much more understandable and you even see mary jane turning her back on him after seeing that being with peter would be too much had peter and norman actually gone along peter would be respected and appreciated more only based on who he is and maybe he would have managed to be a hero but one that would also be selfish since he d have norman s influence but peter makes a heroic choice not the right choice but one that defines him as a hero with a moral code rather than just someone with power and responsability,1
this was too amazing,0
i know what i m doing when i get home lmao,0
train scene makes me cry every time they catch him get him to safety protect his identity as a hero and defend him from the villain just plain beautiful,1
looking back at it maguire wasn t the best spider man he did a really good job as peter but not that great as spider man imo garfield spider man comes closest to the comics the way he moves how he fights by jumping around and using his webs and his environment rather than just punching i remember watching spider man in the theaters as a kid and was blown away but that same feeling isn t there when i rewatched it for me personally into the spider verse was the best spider man movie till date,0
i can understand your side from the suit but not giving its purpose is not because the suit is made for everyone you don t know who is under the mask not seeing peter s face makes the emotions you feel it is like when a game makes a mute protagonist so you project your emotions by your face to them bioshock is a great example looking at the seen with the bus and mary jane what is your reaction surprised shocked at the choice you do this reaction not peter and another thing stain lee stated the mask is made to hides peter s fear because he is scared a lot from losing his life from losing his loved one or people he is trying to save,0
loved this review but felt like i should say this the fights heck any of the fights where peter could ve won in a single hit like you point out this is something that has been pointed out in the comics numerous times most notably in amazing spider man where doc oct in spider man s body punches scorpion s jaw clean off in a single punch killing him in which doc oct realizes spider man could have killed him in any of their previous encounters if he had choose to i believe in a much older comic it s pointed out that it s his spider sense and his own philosophy or mentality that inhibits his strength so he can at one point fight average joe thug down the street and later gray hulk and uppercut him to the moon actual quote from the comic pretty sure he only got him a few feet in the air but look up how much strength it takes to do that specially against someone as heavy as the hulk and not permanently injure either of them and now this is my own conjecture now but to why he doesn t just knock out the bad guy instantly well because it would risk permanent and or fatal injury and because peter wants to do more than just save the day or the innocent he is also trying to save the villain you said it yourself he didn t started out as a hero per se it was his uncle who helped him become the hero he is supposed to be so would it not make sense that peter may have the mindset of if i could change so can you kind of thing,0
there s actually a theory that doc ock is more or less knocked out and has brain damage the whole time and the arms are just using him as a puppet body,0
fun fact in the comics peter parker has stated that he wears a mask precisely for hiding his emotions to not show fear to his enemies so i guess in that regard these films got it right edit i messed up what he uses to hide his fear is not the mask but the constant jokes the mask is primarily to hide his identity,1
i remember when sam raimi apologized to the public for spider man that always rubbed me the wrong way he still tried to make the best movie he could even with the studio interference love or hate it one can t deny how much love went into making these films it shouldn t be raimi who s apologizing here,1
i honestly think my biggest issue with this film is retconning uncle ben s death i don t know i just never liked it,0
i love how you bring up the ferry scene from the mcu spiderman films because i fully believe that that is the point of the ferry scene it s a hollow echo of the train scene because tom holland s spiderman was only on that ferry for a hollow reason he went out looking for a bad guy instead of just finding and stopping a bad guy like he normally does and the reactions of the people present i think are blatantly in support of that empty echo they don t know why the ferry just got sliced in half but spidey s here trying to help so thanks and hooray and such and spiderman fails and needs iron man to bail him out meanwhile on the train everyone was well aware of the danger and watched tobey parker put his all into saving them and thus their standing up for him,1
tears with the end of first film part of the reviw,0
the costume part of the video makes no sense,0
tobey still my favorite and while tom has been great but spider man is still the best to me out of them all,0
i am putting in a request for gintama for the next review series,0
yes thank you,0
another great video,0
i hope this series doesn t completely mirror hi top in saying tobey good everyone else bad,1
i think you should also cover spiderman into the spiderverse since its considered one of if not the best spiderman movie it would be fun to see how the themes in these are reflected on that one,0
context for any non british viewers the guy asking maguire if he got out of shape is jonathan ross who was a presented of a late night interview show and also is just generally a shitty person,0
i m behind i gotta hurry up and watch amazing spiderman and far from home before your next videos lol also i love dr oc you didn t really hit on how he was manipulated and overtook by the ai he didn t really choose to be bad per say though if he could overcome it by sheer force of will at the end he could have at the beginning rather indulge in it i guess,0
i lost my great grandmother a few years ago and i haven t seen spider man since then my great grandmother was exactly like aunt may here little old lady who used to speak softly but proudly watching you talk about aunt may s speech in spider man reminded me so much about my grandmother that i couldn t help but cry thinking about her and how much i missed the support she gave much like aunt may to peter i had to pause the video after you started talking about the fight scenes so i could type this out thank you for that personal slice of your life for taking the time to explain why things like this are so important it never quite clicked as much until you said it i truly feel like watching that part of your video with aunt may s a hero in all of us honestly just helped me process and accept my great grandmother s death i think i ve been holding on to that for too long thank you mark,1
this is why i think sam raimi has the best spider man films i have yet to see tom holland go through the same kind of personal and grounded struggles,0
and then comes sony and disney to burn everything to the ground,0
william dafoe a chef kiss of an amazing actor played green goblin so well he is coming back,0
i thought andrew garfield was a good spider man it s just his movies were mediocre,1
so if octopus it s alive and he is a good guy why is he looking for peter in nowayhome,0
spider man,0
mark seeing how much you love spider man makes me hope you will review some of his comic book stories especially the ones that helped influence these movies,1
we can all agree rosemary harris is the best aunt may,0
great video i agreed with alot like the rosemary harris as aunt may praise and her speech it s so great i do side with norman being a better villain than ock just because goblin felt like a better foil to spiderman and peter while ock really doesn t have a dynamic with spidey,1
this was an amazing video mark and i m sorry for your loss man i lost my stepdad a few months ago i hope your doing good and now for the garfield movies,1
this is a great video one of my favorite videos you ve made in a long time because of how genuine you were while talking about your feelings about the character and how they changed over time,0
while yes tobey is my favorite i really enjoy all spider man movies,0
why is the movie audio only coming through the right side the rest of the video is fine it s only the movie clips that do it,0
pizza time,0
cant believe how much i love this video,0
im just happy spider man received some love it trully deserves that movie may not be perfect but it definently have perfect moments and a reason to exist and i m happy i m not the only one who sees it,1
that gfuel ad is the best ad mark has done yet,0
honestly i think toms suits are the worst,0
amazing review mark perfectly capsulated the heart themes of the raimi trilogy spider man is the weakest of the trilogy for sure but it s not a bad conclusion at all it s not a rise of skywalker that effectively ruined the overall trilogy story it s painfully clear that what raimi originally intended for the third film was a deeply personal villian in harry osborn as the new goblin after all in the first movie he was completely overshadowed in the eyes of his father by peter then in the second film after the death of his father he becomes a successful business man but his father isn t there to see it in his eyes bc of spider man after he wrongfully thinks spidey killed him in the second movie he hates spider man resents peter for not telling him how he can find him leading to him finding out that peter is spider man then given the means to enact his revenge when he finds the goblin tech this should ve clearly been built up to the finally of his arc in the third movie at first it seems like that s what s gonna happen after all in begins with harry injecting himself w the gas norman did then attacking peter w no warning perfect chief kiss you did it but then he gets amnesia for rlly no reason other than raimi was forced to do the venom symbiote stuff when he didn t rlly want to knew having villains was too much so he sacrificed harry s arc to make room for venom sandman originally he wanted the villains to be harry as the main one sandman as a secondary villian but the studio pushed heavily for venom so changes had to be made honestly it s fine as a conclusion to the trilogy as is despite being the weakest of the trilogy but i am saddened i didn t get to see harry be the true final villian of the film completing his negative arc like just imagine if the final fight had harry do something like kill aunt may threaten mj causing peter to get furious savagely beat harry into near death only stopping by mj s direct intervention then having peter harry having one last heart to heart leading to harry sacrificing himself after realizing what he s done what he s become that would ve been better than what we got overall,0
anyone as surprised as me to see joey diaz at xd,0
honestly the worst part of the raimi films are their fans these films meant so much to me growing up and were some of my favorite movies ever but they ended and i was okay with that i loved the tom holland movies and thought they were every bit of my favorite character in any piece of media but then the toxic raimi fans crawled out of their holes and started bashing the mcu films out of defense for one of my favorite interpretations of the character i started picking at all the flaws in the raimi films by the time i had realized what was happening it was too late my mind had associated the raimi films with their toxic fans i can still watch enjoy and see how objectively good these films are but because of gatekeeping spider man fans i am now incapable of looking back fondly on three beloved films from my childhood,1
idc what people say i have and will always love spider man the most out of the trilogy of course it has it s problems but i can easily look past that especially since i know what happened behind the scenes,0
oh yeah it s gonna be a good day,0
wow i genuinely forgot how good the toby maguire spider man movies were,0
something to think about with otto s seeming resistance to peter s giga punches he still has the mechanical arms that can extend and retract a lot of the damage that occurs in fistfights comes from the grounding of the target when you re in your stance and immovable you can retain your position for a counter but the impacts are harder otto has the arms to his advantage and they are able to cushion his hits and absorb the impacts so while his body is still taking some pretty heavy blows most of the force is going straight through him and into the hydraulics of the arms,1
in the comics i guess peter rolling the hits he takes and the punches he throws became so annoying to some people that in superior spider man doc oc as spider man breaks a guys jaw without trying i have a feeling the movies and more dramatic moments in comics caused this to happen,0
can we talk about how spiderman didn t know the sandman would survive the train grind that was an attempted murder,0
actually in the comics doc ock himself states how much peter is pulling his hits while hitting normal human beings like him accepting if it should suffice or not is a personal matter in the end,1
i really enjoyed the video as a big spiderman fan however i must point out that i disagree to some extent with the mask part i get where you re coming from but i would like to point out one obvious thing and one more in character thing the obvious one being that since it is a real costume it is hard to reflect properly what a drawing can do with ease now the other thing it s the importance of the mask in some comics peter has stated that the mask helps him to be more brave since he is able to hide his fear he really feels when encountering dangerous situations with this in mind i feel the mask fulfills it s role since we re unable to see how he truly feels on the situations he feels more invencible this makes the moments where he actually takes it away or gets it damaged one to reveal more of his face the more powerful we re shown in those moments the reality that being that inside the invencible heroe s mask there s a vulnerable teenager this is in fact one of the major points of the spiderman stopping the train scene people see spiderman as a unstoppable heroe they thought he was a capable adult due to his abilities and then an unmasked spiderman that saved them faints so it s their time to save him in the realization that he s pretty young and that he can be beaten embracing even more the message that there s a hero in all of us,0
i m sorry about your grandmother and your father and what you went through mark i lost my grandfather as well also during march of i didn t get to say goodbye either since he lived in peru and the shutdowns didn t allow for anyone to travel so both my mother and i lost that chance to say goodbye or even be at the funeral which didn t even do justice to his memory since gatherings couldn t be had it s tough man and i am glad you are ok now i just want to say thank you for the work you do i appreciate all the incredible effort and man i love your vids,0
yeah yeah the video is phenomenal but can we talk about mark s ad game tho,0
this is a coment to boost this video cause you are amazing and deserve to earn as much money for your anime videos as for your pasion projects,0
great video mark it actually helped to change my perspective about the third movie i never thought it was bad but that it fall off short in comparison to the previous ones something that i think you missed in your inspection is when in the second movie peter goes to the rescue inside the burning building and he finds out that someone didnt make it it makes him realise that he wont be good enough saving people as peter parker as he will be saving people as spider man,1
please add spiderman into the spider verse in your review,0
to think that joey diaz saved spiderman what a time to be alive,0
great video,0
i don t like your retrospect of spider man definitely a bias from me but spider man has the most depth out of the least from the meaning of what spider man itself idealizes,0
i can only like this video one time and it makes me sad,0
like there was any question of which would come first,0
commenting for comments sake,0
these were the only spiderman movies i ever saw because we never went to the movie theater when i was a kid and these were the only ones my parents bought and i loved these movies i find they don t hold up as well as they did years ago especially the effects but i still very much like them and i still think they were the best superhero movies at the time looking forward to the andrew garfield and tom holland videos maybe i can watch the movies before the videos get out,0
an amazing video review you capture the very essence why i love spider man so much,0
i dont get it some like you think that the aunt may character is great for other people is the most annoying character,0
honestly i still don t agree with you about peter being the villain in part if the trilogy is about responsibility then both sandman and venom should be responsible for their actions just because peter goes to far doesn t mean they shouldn t be held accountable and i would argue peter didn t go to war with eddie brock,0
holy shit the controversy this is gonna make,0
mark i mean this when i say this may be one of the if not the best video you ve ever made really really well done just a side note i know you don t do video game reviews but if you were to do one on the spider man ps game i think you would really enjoy it as well if you haven t already played it,1
spiderman is a good movie anyone disagreeing is a c nt,1
squid game review teaser right here,0
fantastic video man love the work you do keep it up,0
to me these are simply the best ones disney ones are kinda formulaic and garfield s are just bad lmao,0
i also think that people hated spider man because peter was emo and emo kids were target of homophobia because of their style also it didnt changed peter into what they believed was a bad ass but what peter believed,0
um mark did you mean to cut the audio of the scenes you show when youre not saying anything,0
hmm ok,0
don t forget that spiderman has an absolute horror scene in it that was totally unexpected when i first watched it,0
for those who don t know in every film bruce campbell is credited as quinton beck a k a mysterio i like to think they are purposely setting him up to be the big bad of a future film,1
i would love to see a spiderverse vid seeing how the suits have so much expression and you can see what they are thinking about keep up the amazing work mark,1
superior spiderman breaks scorpions jaw look it up my dude is holding back alot,0
when you watch spiderman you should see it like you would see comedy movie because imo that is what it is and it s truly a great comedy,0
spiderman getting some love finally,0
damn now i gotta rewatch these movies again,0
i loved this video you perfectly broke down what made these stories great also nice touch at the end with ps spider man movie game music,0
very close,0
honestly the degree of positivity for this video makes me worried he ll tear the amazing spider man apart the nd film i don t mind as much at all the only good parts are the action visuals effects and choreography the rest is something but the amazing spider man in my opinion is by far the most realistic of all of the movies i don t mind in terms of visuals or anything like that i m talking about the characters peter parker in the amazing spider man does every single decision a year old teen would do if you ask me in spider man it s kind of all of a sudden yes he starts by using his powers selfishly and not doing the right thing leads to ben s death so he realizes that he s supposed to use those powers for good i get it but in the amazing spider man he doesn t realize that he acts like an anti hero until captain stacy just lays it on him during dinner and what follows is the famous bridge scene where he must make a choice between the lizard or saving a child why did he go to the bridge in the first place because something big seems to happen over there he s a teen he s curious he loves using his powers feeling like he can do things no one can but that s not all there is he seens captain stacy the man who was criticizing him just a few moments earlier go in a hurry and investigate peter might have wanted to prove to this man he was doing the right thing or perhaps taunt him by doing his job right in front of his face but when he s at that bridge anyone with the same powers as him would have done the same prioritize rescuing the child instead of pursuing the lizard right after the bridge scene we see him staring at his mask realizing that there s a lot more he can with those powers he went there because there was trouble but there everything lead to him saving the child and now he realizes everything he could have done had he had that precise objective the whole time at first it s curiosity now it s responsibility and the movie makes that very clear because right after stacy announces a warrant for his arrest there s now some genuine drawbacks to being spier man and helping people but now that he understands his lesson he doesn t care he knows he has a moral obligation to use those powers to stop that beast and save people i gotta go after it that s not your job maybe it is i hope mark sees all that and i have faith he will,1
if you haven t i recommend you the spiderman game that came for the ps great video btw,0
that g fuel ad was absolutely amazing but also that personal anecdote you shared was very similar to something i went through last year i m sorry for your loss and happy to hear your dad pulled through,0
i actually cried a lot more than i would ve liked growing up with the sam trilogy i m very thankful for mark making this amazing review,1
in the comic spider man is notorious for pulling his punches the guy has incredible levels of super strength he can break trough steel easily he tries his best not to hurt people,1
no matter how good tom holland is this is my spiderman i ll never not appreciate these movies for what they did to me in my younger years,1
mark you better review the s movie,0
god this video was beyond god tier thank you for explaining how all of feel about these movies tobey is the goat spider man,0
i know this probably might be burred in the sea of comments but i d like to say that the new yorkers defense to spider man while he s unconscious brings a tear to my eye while the action has been repeated several times in other spider man medias that scene where normal people who appreciate this one man who risks his very being for them and in turn doing the same for him is beautiful in a big world where so many bad and scary things happen for seemingly no reason at all this scene reminds me of the human kindness anyone is capable of the unity a community can have together aunt may rosemary harris is right there s a hero in all of us thank you for glancing over my comment,0
great job on the video you can really see the time effort and heart you put into it but when it comes to spider man my take has always been that mary jane is the true villain of that story she is so self absorbed and nagging it s hard to care about anything that s happening to her she does nothing but bring the hero down and try to destroy his life at almost every turn peter makes plenty of mistakes in the movie but mary jane actively hides things and cheats on him fails to support him as a partner when things are finally looking up for him then knowingly goes along with junior goblin s plan to break peter s heart she s completely unsympathetic and makes the movie feel miserable,1
great video,1
who put these tears on my face,0
after rewatching the raimi movies i hadnt realised how utterly brutal some of the action is how serious and un quippy spider man becomes once the fighting starts and how fast paced and efficiently the story unfolds there s a weird sense of silliness until the herp on villain battles start and then it s suddenly a life or death violent bloody struggle where spider man gets brutalised and has to gut his way to victory that climatic goblin fight is visceral they re so much more violent tangible and less formulaic than the mcu entries which are slicker and more expansive but feel oddly watered down and safe compared to the original trilogy great great films from raimi,1
holy shit a david fincher edward norton spider man in the tone of fight club there would be no way people prefer tom over that,0
unpopular opinion but i prefer topher grace s eddie brock over tom hardy not venom but eddie himself,0
in regards to peter s strength there s actually a scene in superior spiderman that addresses this doc ock in peter s body punches unless i m misremembering one of kingpin s minion and completely takes off his jaw ock then thinks holy shit peter has been pulling his punches so much this entire time,0
nobody totaly not mark watch me speed run becoming a crazed fan boi of a movie series just to do my job,0
testing out how much he should pull his punches would be pretty unethical better to be mistakenly hitting to soft then too hard especially when he probably likely doesn t want to kill his opponent,1
im so happy to see reviews like these that help me out why i love these movies into words as well as help me appreciate things i never realized i hope after spideycember he eventually comes back to review spider verse no way home and possibly spider verse if it s out by then,0
you don t always need to see characters face for them to convey emotion,0
i had to double check my add blocker i thought one got through it was so convincing,0
this was a real treat to watch,0
i never realized how similar the green goblin death scene was to frieza s,0
as much as these films are the ultimate spider man piece of genre but you should review the ps game story,1
think peter think if you give me spiderman pictures i will use them against him,0
i love the tobey movies because they exemplify the campiness of spider man and sam rami makes god tier movies,0
i d love to see a review for some of the animated spiderman series that s the content farm that i m craving at least,0
i absolutely agree aunt may melts my heart with every word its so funny that her actor does not know i exist yet she couldn t comprehend how she made me feel lol,1
toby maguire is peak spiderman as an adult tom holland is peak spiderman as a teen,0
i miss the final swings,0
jajajaja that ad is really amazing,0
with the point you pulled up at i think you would be interested in the superior spider man comic run where doc ock takes control of peter s body even he was shocked and makes mention of just how much peter must have held back when fighting against him,0
i m curious with andrew films cuz mark video was a motional roller coaster for me for toeby films,0
im not sure if i d say tobey is the very best spiderman but he s definitely my favourite lol,0
i know this is only covering the movies and the only video series like this we ll get for a while but i m really curious what mark would think about the spectacular spider man animated series,0
i think the reason peter can t instantly down otto is fear he s scared to hurt him because he knows how strong he is i don t think he has as fine a control over his strength as he d like so he s constantly worried about accidentally killing him by punching his head off i think he s pulling his punches more than he needs to because he doesn t know the razor thin line between a knock out and a murder,1
i had to like just for that amazing g fuel ad,0
i love your work so much thanks,0
seeing stan lee s cameos in this movie especially the ones where he basically paraphrases the messages he played a part in conveying through the comics just makes me miss him so much more,1
this video is really amazing,0
the birth of sandman in spider man was one of the most awe inspiring thing i saw everything from the moment the first sand pebble starts forming him losing his form for a second only for him to bring himself back together again including the soundtrack jesus it s so damn beautiful,1
damn mark doesn t like when you can t see mouth movements from a mask power rangers super sentai and kamen rider must be hell for him,0
i feel sam raimi is an extremely competent director who knows how to work with his actors the faults of spider man was due to the studio making changes and the weak script this caused if there were two villains that being sandman and green goblin then it might have been good,1
is this a possible teaser to an mcu franchise review next year,0
man to hit me hard i could relate in the things you said and your story i think it s the first time i cried watching a youtube video spidey is my childhood favorite hero i was even younger than you were and i think there s a lot of things i didn t understand that you brought up to light now i just want to watch it again with a different perspectiv this review is a masterpiece thank you for the time and effort you put in cheers,0
one other thing about the train fight is that i dont think that otto is truly a bad guy like i dont think he really wanted to kill everyone my evidence is how he throws the people towards spiderman instead of more to the side to allow him to catch them and save them i also think he knew spiderman could stop the train or at least save everyone on that train,0
it kinda impresses me how you re able to ignore so many of spider man s issues for the sake of the narrative that is playing in your head spider man being able to oneshot doc is not a nitpick doc having spider man s head between his able to deploy hidden blade arms and not killing him is not a nitpick don t call nitpick whatever that is actually relevant to the scene at play don t equate a different shirt of someone in the background with the movie would literally end then and there if characters acted and reacted as they should i like the movie but i hate this avoid the bad at all costs mentality for the sake of painting it as better than it actually is it has its strengths so don t manufacture any more or downplay its weaknesses the fake slow cracky video essayer voice to make the viewer agree off of their emotions is just annoying,0
sam raimi s spider man trilogy has mean so much to me as a child and more as an adult the consequences of all his actions leads him to such a struggled and harsh life but in time learns why it s necessary to go through and that life will get better this character is incredibly relatable and everyone else is treated with care and respect no live action spider man will live up to this type of passion project,1
solid video i like it,0
i think here you perfectly laid out what i didn t understand of why i liked spider man where most everyone i know didn t i didn t care or really know about venom at the time i knew spider man almost predominantly through the movies and video games rather than the comics or animated series so for me i was able to go into it and enjoy the story it wanted to tell while also really connecting with both harry and peter in what is essentially their redemption quests i really hope that this helps people come around on spider man a bit more overall,0
regarding how spidey can punch doc oc and not kill him it s exactly as you said he pulls his punches there s a scene in the comics where he launches a hulk not the main hulk but a version of the character into space and another one where doc oc swaps bodies with spiderman and realizes just how strong he is when you re that strong then the difference between hard enough to knock someone out and strong enough to kill them must be minute imagine trying to flick a marble and have it roll cm but it can t go more than so i just like to think that he always errs on the side of too gentle plus it makes the action scenes more fun if he doesn t just one punch man everything,1
that ad really bothered me i was so confused when it started and honestly it felt underhanded since it didn t have any disclaimer,0
got me right in the heart right in the feels wow mark im still sobing and half crying while typing this cant wait for the next spidey review,1
your speech about your family and your fear of death really hit me because i went through the same thing when spiderman came out in you are right hearing rosemary harris speech today brought tears to my eyes because its very moving to me as always thank you for your reviews mark,1
look i m not the biggest fan of these three films my superhero obsession started with the amazing spider man so i m biased towards those two films but i absolutely love spider man it is absolutely and objectively the best spider man film,0
brice campbell had all the different jobs to set him up as mysterio in spider man which probably want the plan from the beginning but would have been a hilarious payoff,0
i love these videos your review on the third movie man it makes parallels to an unhealthy coping mechanism to the symbiotic suit man,0
yo mark amazing video been waiting for it to drop ever since you announced it it s always a treat to hear someone talk about spider man i think to this day no other movie has quite captured all the hardships that come with the responsibility with being spider man i think that spider man and into the spiderverse are the best at showcasing what a spider man story is all about,0
mark i love this opening act far more than i did before let me guess its the memes right you know im something of a meme lover myself,1
mark s ability to showcase the good in nest of the works he reviews has legitimately given me a more positive outlook on life itself,1
i think ur incredibly over analyzing the mask i find no issue with it i can careless about his facial reacitons spiderman has always been an acrobatic type of person and his body experessions is what tells him not his face and that photo used of the comic smile looks horrific bro,0
andrew and his movies rly got screwed over by sony if they would ve let marc webb and andrew actually make the movies they d envisioned i guarantee you that andrew would be most people s favorite spider man he played the character with so much heart and made him feel so human to me tobey and raimi s interpretation felt more like an icon tom and mcu spider man feel like i m watching a sit com half the time which i m not saying is bad but andrew made me feel truly feel that spider man could be a real person walking amongst us all,0
unpopular opinion this was the worst spider man movie series growing up it was amazing on rewatch i cringe great video though mark,0
great video mark i m honestly impressed you were able to get this done in a week i also really enjoyed what you had to say about venom and the animated spider man series that came out in the s he was mentioned briefly in the video but hitop films did a three part review series on sam rami s spider man trilogy and i can t recommend watching it enough the total length of all three parts put together is over hours so yeah he goes in depth into why the movies are great why they re important to him and why you should love them they re also really well crafted so it doesn t feel like watching over half an hour of review each time,0
pog,0
thank you so much finally someone on the internet that gives spider man a fair chance without just saying it s bad because venom isn t like in the comics or oh there are too many characters or emo peter dancing i feel like for years i ve been one of the only people on earth who likes this film and had to constantly justify myself to people who never wanted to give it a chance,1
i recently watched this trilogy with my son this year and i felt pretty similar about the movie it upset me much more when i first watched it because of my childhood love for venom as the villain turned antihero in the animated series overall not bad with some strong moments mixed into what could have probably been a great movie with some different choices made with integrating venom,1
with great power comes great responsibility,0
you are one of the few people who i can feel i relate with life and my love of things around me and the there s a hero in all of us put me in tears i just wanted to thank you you and your channel is one of the reason i have faith in humanity,0
everyone always asks how otto is able to take a punch and yet fail to see what a mountain of a man octavias is i mean he can leverage those four arms with his human legs,0
i think it s important to remember that the original spiderman was drawn with that mask because it was easier than drawing the same face at different angles it does detract from the actor s performance but most of the movies find ways around that in the most emotionally intense scenes,1
thank you for this mark that aunt may speech is so amazing,0
this was honestly a emotional video to watch thank you for the amazing video,0
glad i caught this before it got hit excelsior,0
alex from hitopfilms would be proud of this,0
cool video to see you make,0
goddamn mark acted his ass of for that g fuel xd,0
great video i recently rewatched the trilogy last year i think and loved every moment of it can t wait to see the ending of the newest trilogy in a couple weeks,0
man i m glad i got to this before sony shit all over it thank you for being so open to share how your experiences impacted your reading of these films,0
mark i ve been watching you for a long time ever since you reviewed goku s character the amount of attention to detail you put on every video makes you not just my favorite reviewer but my hero i lost my grandmother as well but she had been sick for years so in a way it was a relief but i never got to say goodbye she lived in africa and i was in america and what s worse she ll never see what i was going to be in the future so thank you very much for reviewing this movie and reminding me what s really important,1
the mouth argument with the costume design felt like a major knitpick lmao,0
has totally not mark seen the spectacular spider man animated series,0
this is going to fell very similar to hightopsfilm,0
wow ok i usually think of you as the anime guy never thought you would do something like this cool,0
spiderman films reminds me of the batman films like the batman and spiderman were both hits had impact on the film industry both had their successes and downfalls and got up again,0
love hearing that ps spider man music in the background yuri lowenthal is easily my favorite spidey,0
oddly enough the rd movie came to me more as what if the responsibility is too much,0
good video mr mark,0
please you have to review the spectacular spiderman animated show,0
can t wait for the next episode,0
it s because i only have one working side to my headphones but every time it goes to a movie clip there are no voices just background sounds to the scene like squeaking shoes and cars,0
this video made me smile the biggest smile in a long time i felt at piece and happy despite the stress of finals going on right now this was amazing pun intended,0
superb amazing video mark you really put it in words why spider man is also my favourite superhero it was always because of sam raimi s movies but i couldn t quite put it into words as to why but you did it beautifully here i genuinely teared up a little bit while watching this video really great work,0
honestly lot of creators slow down and stop posting as much or leave but i ve been with you since dbza commentary and this i love you bro thank you for everything you have become my most regular and weekly joy,0
i m so glad that this channel goes in a general nerd direction now are any other comic book movies planned in so excited for the other movies and ofc when naruto berserk continues,1
why is the suit so important when discussing spider man i find it so interesting no other superhero movie videogame adaptation gets so must focus on that part of the character maybe batman but not at the same level,0
i swear mark could make a review of hello kitty and still make me cry,1
idk if you noticed this but while i was watching this i noticed that in spider man every characters face would be lit up according to their intentions fully lit good half lit conflicted or misleading not lit bad especially shown when peter and otto are having a conversation peters face is either half lit or mostly fully lit while otto is always half lit no matter where his head is facing there are other examples but that s the most clear one since it happens right before otto changes,0
out of all the characters in marvel i believe spider man is the most relatable character especially when you can see both sides of peter parker and spider man,0
think my issue with venom in spider man will always be that it doesn t feel like you can do the entire black suit storyline plus venmon in a single movie,0
ok i m commenting and just wanna say shed a tear watching this,0
i understand this is for the movies but your thoughts on the mask had me pull back to the ps game where i would say is the best alternative for the mask as it works like hollands suit with technoligical lenses that fluctuate move and emote as a camera while still just being a just a simple mask actually putting a piece of peter somewhat into spiderman instead of treating them as two seperate entities,0
after naruto you should take a look at spectacular spider man,0
if you re a fan of venom watch spectacular spderman which takes ques from how they were portrayed in the the ultimate comics,0
yeah and i just finished watching spiderman yesterday,0
who is this chinless slug they got here he stinks and i don t like him,0
lol your complain about the mask go agaisnt what spider man represents and what the suit means for him he doesn t need to show his face he can be spider man villains can t see the fear in his face he is just a symbol a character apart from his human self etc etc it has been mentioned in many comics arcs and the movies that s why it s annoying for actors playing spider man taking the mask off any seconds so we could see the actor and the paid was well spent it s unrealistic annoying and goes agaisnt what spider man represents,0
mark you re slowly becoming one of my favorite youtubers keep going,0
while i do think the mask design philosophy is a fair critique as it is an inherent issue when transferring the facial expressions of a dude wearing a mask from comics to live action the spidey mask in live action works because you can t tell who s supposed to be in the mask unlike other marvel heroes who either don t care about hiding their identities or would like the whole world to know who they are under the mask like your iron mans your doctor stranges your guardians of the galaxy and so on spidey has always been a character where no matter which incarnation or universe the spidey comes from the mask is always a blank slate for whatever that version of spidey is as a person underneath the title of being a spider man anybody can wear the mask as a certain animated film about a spider verse would like to say which was an aspect of spider man as a general character that i feel like wasn t really brought up when addressing the mask issue as much as it was an issue for peter being the only spider man to exist within the three live action universes,1
these films have that silly over the top cliche quality that i think superhero movies dont have anymore and i miss it these movies are what i would describe as the perfect guilty pleasure there so uplifting and just make you feel good watching them maybe not the best at being movies but as comic book movies perfect,0
tobey is the true spiderman the other after him are just disney and sony trying to recreate that magic but always failing tom holland seems like a nice kid but sorry your storyline is the most basic sh t with no real conflict,1
thanks mark didn t know i was setting up to cry through my entire lunch break,0
amazing,0
people should be more like spider man,0
man i wish i watched the same movies mark did the original spiderman trilogy was way worse than i remembered i found toby mcguires acting comically bad not as bad as james franco he felt like he should have been in batman and robin raimi apparently is incapable of writing a female character each movie mj somehow got worse and worse and i dont believe that was kristen dunsts fault raimi s portrayal of peter and mj s relationship might be the worst aspect of these movies and for some reason thoughout all of these movies i really wanted to punch peter in the face i should not want to punch spiderman in the face theres other problems with the original trilogy i still dont see how anyone who s rewatched them recently can say toby is the best spiderman or peter parker that being said despite the flaws throughout the triolgy spiderman still slaps hard which is funny cause they were literally writing the script as they made the movie,0
arguably one of my fave vids you ve made so far phenomenal job also glad to see someone else appreciate the genius that is toby maguire s dancing abilities,0
crazy dude from hq definitely spidey is my fav hero too great video now i wanna rewatch the first and myb the rd lol,0
this video is beyond awesome mark,0
spider man it s cool and all but naruto,0
this version is an accurate representation of the comic book lv grounded yet fantastical world of spider man,1
so something to keep in mind is the force of a punch is acceleratiom mass spideys grip strength and how much he can lift wouldnt affect that that much really at least that s my head cannon,0
will you do a video about spider man into the spider verse because it is the best spider man movies no arguments,0
definitely did this trilogy justice very well done,1
this timing is perfect since i just finished the trilogy today and man was that ride a masterpiece spiderman is easily one of my favourite movies of all time tbh same with and is also great i just didn t love it as much as the other,1
spider man is the greatest fictional character of all time,0
this was a great video essay makeing me want to go back a rewatch these films knowing this,0
woo get to see uncle ben get shot all month,0
spider man is criminally underrated despite its messiness it all sort of works for me every villain represents a different theme and dilemma for spider man it s got some of raimi s best directed sequences it s visually stunning and his directorial stamp is all over it unlike many modern comic book films it s human drama is great it s style is slick and fun somedays i like it more than the first but the nd will always be the high point of the trilogy,0
hitop films shout out crossover of the century love this mark truly appreciate you doing these,0
thank you mark,0
the only thing that i don t agree with is the mask thing i understand your point but stan lee has said many times that he made the suit like that because there can be anyone behind the mask,0
literally my favorite weekly uploading youtube channel,0
as much as i love ya mark you really built up these movies too much i see them more as comedies now then anything else they re classics but really don t hold up as well anymore peter losing his powers cause he didn t wanna be spider man anymore as the dumbest thing in that entire trilogy while i loved those movies growing up they re def not great movies,0
are you gonna review into the spiderverse,0
the green goblin has the same problem with the costume as spiderman would have been great to see him emote more you should see the original ideas for his costume actually it looked pretty great,0
hot take these films are perfect for the time period but they are like shrek in that their legacy stems more from the internet memeing the hell out of them especially in the case with spider man between the tobey in the mcu videos that emerged a few years back to the recent trend of putting the same two or three bully maguire moments into random scenes from movies shows and even anime and it can be detrimental to the films themselves,1
well done i really liked this video i love spider man,0
i loved your podcast appearance with my friend che on anime to z i would love to see some vinland saga content from you in the future,0
amazing video i have been following your reviews and takes on anime and they are great speaking about the spiderman holding up his punches in the comics this has been stated as totally true in spiderman leading up to superior spiderman dock ock has gained control over peter s body fighting the scorpion he takes down half of his jaw with a single punch because he wasn t holding up like peter does in every fight this is because peter refuses to kill someone even if it is an enemy so in every single fight he doesn t use his full strength specially with enemies like dock ock that have non super human abilities amazing video dude you should check out superior spiderman for fun and shaman king for more videos in the future,0
was that a gachi edit,1
the spider man at least from the start is truly something that changed my life and i will never forget the first time i was introduced to spectacular story would hook me for the rest of my life and i m thankful for that teaching me life lessons i still keep close to my chest and model myself after through the struggle going through pain and having responsibilities truly spider man is an everyman and flaws and all but what makes us but that s what us human and that s what makes spider man a great symbol of all of that,1
spider man is still the best spider man movie by far imo,1
love the video first off but i think the issue with the mask muting the emotions in the scenes you mentioned early in the video is a problem to work around with tony in the mcu they can give us a glimpse every now and then from inside the helmet i personally don t have a problem with the lack of emotions that the mask presents i think it adds mystery and really helps the super hero aspect of always looking brave and confident maybe those aren t the best words but for me it works but i understand you having issues with it,0
bro i almost cried,0
rami needed to get a toku actor in to teach toby and the stuntmen how to act in a face concealing mask,0
i guess i need to buy some gfuel now geez,0
mark the incredible the spectacular me the amazing mark the iconic me am i a joke to you,0
damn it i m gonna watch all the movies now,0
i grew up with tobey maguire as my spidey he is the reason i love spidey but looking back at those movies i feel they haven t aged as well the dialogue and directing are a bit over the top i still like them just not to the extent as the tom holland ones,0
i know we re supposed to talk about spider man in the comments but mark you seriously like awakened something in me speaking about your lockdown experience and being afraid to die now my father passed from the covid out break and recently my grandmother left this life and now i just feel anxious and scared all the time and realizing i will suffer that same fate made me feel so seen and warm man thank you so much,0
aaaaand this video like others will get removed just watch and see,0
honestly loved his rendition because he really felt like a boy coming into the adult world with brand new powers he feels believable real he s cringey funny annoying sometimes dumb sometimes smart others and the arc he has in spider man feels believable,1
well i look at this from the other side peter treats spider man as a completely different man he is the direct opposite to peter the face shell helps emphasize this feeling of two different men spider man being always no face movement at all confident extroverted as goblin said spider man is invincible but peter parker peter parker vice versa is introverted questioning his actions vulnerable and has the same problems every normal human does at the end of the movie during the final fight half of peter s face is still spider man but the other half is peter parker which i think resembles that this fight is not only spider man s but also peter parker s personally,1
god i really want tobey maguier to be the old jaded drunken spidey from the spuderverse movie that would make the entire movie for me,0
as a fan of toku power rangers i disagree with the helmet being a hinderance to the emotional moments and the holland helmet doesn t feel like a bandaid more a natural evolution,0
its amazing how when we rewatch things we loved as kids we learn to appreciate them from an entirely different angle while we don t have the same pure enjoyment and excitement we had as kids we gained the ability to appriciate writing aspects which are only available to us as adults its fascinating,1
i understand has problems but it s my favorite,0
i rewatched those movies recently and you know what the first one is the best even better than the nd one,0
i really like tom hollands spiderman but the fact that he doesn t struggle financially like tobeys or andrews spidermans really annoys me because a core part of spiderman is the fact that he has to juggle so many things in his life and the financial component always connected me and so many others to spiderman because it showed that you don t have to be rich to be good or to be a hero i do see myself in hollands spiderman because i m a teen and the way he acts and the way he talks is just like me and my friends but the fact that he has tony starks bank account and help all the time really created a disconnect i hope they fix cause tom hollands spiderman doesn t feel like spiderman except when he helps people and when he doesn t use any special gadgets or cool and advanced suit,0
the best part of the videos are by far the gfuel ads,0
what a fantastic video you really captured why i have always loved spiderman from the s cartoon to now,0
the writing on this channel is outstanding,0
tobey is deffo number one,0
god speed not mark,0
oh shi babe totallynotmark posted a vid about spider man oh wait i don t got one,0
my rolemodel,0
wait a second is that lucy lawless i legit never noticed that until just now,0
spider man content let s goooo,0
not gonna lie mark that add was something else,0
awesome job their is a slight issue with the sound of the movie bits could you make them st r o their is only sound on the right ears of my headsets and it s quite uncomfortable keep up the good work can t wait for next week episode,0
about the mask thing i believe that why it always gets damage at the final scenes so you can see peter s expression and reaction to the most intense moment in the movie but you are correct for the majority its expressionless,0
i fucking love this trilogy i m glad you covered this fuck i she s tears on the aunt may part idk why,0
the raimi trilogy ages like the finest wine it has something for everyone small edit regarding spider man not being able to knock octavius out first off as many have stated he pulls his punches because he can kill another superhuman with bare fists alone and with ease nd i m rather certain the arms being an advanced ai are able to control octavius pain reception and stimuli post accident and rd they do provide him with a flexible yet firm way to efficiently roll with peter s punches lessening the already restrained effect just my cents enjoy the movie,1
pizza time,0
i m sure you already have it planned but please include into the spider verse in this series shameik moore jake johnson hailee steinfeld and all of the other spiders in that film gave fantastic performances and really explored what it means to be spider man,1
i want to say that toby s popularity as spiderman is purely based on bully mcguire don t get me wrong there are things to love about those films but there s a lot to dislike as well however the memes of it all extended its life and popularity,0
i think mark should read superior spider man,0
i was waiting for these videos and you exceeded all my expectations thank you guys,0
willem dafoe nailed his role absolute legend,1
my argument that he can t knock out doc oq is that his brain stem was affected when getting fused with those arms therefore his cns and pns are not normal like a regular human he has minds the arms and his new super brain,0
plz review spider verse too,0
great video make sure you have both headphones on or its just crickets when he references film footage in the right channel only lmao,0
spider man is still my favorite hero the rami movies are amazing i still remember going to see spider man with my mom dad my new born baby brother my grandpa my great aunt and great grandma it was the last movie i saw with my grandpa i remember that he said that was fun buddy we ll watch the next one with all the popcorn we can eat just the two of us when spider man came out i got two bags and set it right by my seat,0
i hope he will also review spidervers,0
spider man theme from marvel vs capcom best music lol,0
love mr sunday movies,0
i had to pause the video to comment on the g fuel ad it is a masterpiece lol the effort put into that ad demands recognition,0
yess been waiting for this one,0
best add ever,0
i had the same experience with my father unfortunately without the happy ending i miss him every day even though it s been almost years now thank you for sharing this moment with us,1
too many goats in one video,0
man i needed to hear that about there being a hero in all of us coping with stress reaching the end of the student life is somewhat difficult and thank you for bringing to light something i would have otherwise missed,1
how else wants a spectacular spiderman review,0
just gonna say it the whole costume section of the video is kinda ridiculous,0
i almost spilled my tea laughing when the g fuel narrator started stringing together random words to sound profound,0
peter has to hold back in these fights because of how strong he truly is in the superior spider man run for example when doc ock took over his body he didnt know how strong he truly was and when he punched the scorpion with no restraints he ripped off his jaw by accident,1
nostalgia is a hell of a drug holland is a better peter parker garfield is a better spider man holland is the best overall imo,0
these movies are just so fun,1
the second greatest movie trilogy in history what the greatest kung fu panda and i m not joking,0
tobey maguire isn t a perfect adaptation of spider man by any means but he s probably the best live action one so far and that mostly comes down to how well his character arcs were and his fight scenes he s the one who felt like he had the most substance tom feels like a disney sitcom character and andrew would ve been better if he had better stuff to work with,1
tnm phrase word starter pack the likes of cathartic philosophical,1
i may be alone on this but i love all spider men in different ways maguire is honestly awkward with the mask on and doesnt have as much of the spidey charm but i think is a great peter parker especially in his relationship in movie aside from emo but that s just dumb fun to watch anyway garfield isnt the best out of the mask but shines in the charisma and wit of spiderman even in the full costume s first debut holland doesnt excel in either category but i think is the best of both worlds coming to a fun compromise in the middle that the prior two couldnt pull off consistently i havent seen many of the movies firsthand in a while i just remember these as my personal thoughts back when watching the movies for the first time,1
man i had a lot of fun watch this video it makes me want to watch old spider man again,0
mark this video is amazing so far don t get me wrong but good lord we need to talk about that hollywood level g fuel ad in the best way,1
tobey maguire us my favorite,1
see tnm drop a vid it s an hour long it s about spider man day made,0
man i can t wait for next october for into the spiderverse,0
bully maguire getting the praise lmao love to see it,1
your epic ad almost convinced me to buy overpriced worst water well done,0
hyped for the tasm and mcu reviews looks like fridays is gonna be good,0
also has the best soundtrack of all the films don t even lie,0
i think one of the main reasons tobey s spider man being a naturally good natured person as opposed to the comic counterpart works is that this is a movie you have to be efficient with your characters to not bloat the runtime while in the comics we can get peter s slow progression from a vengeful bully victim to a selfless person over the course of dozens of comic issues not a timeframe the movies could afford basically short term narrative vs long term narrative,1
i came for praise for the raimi trilogy and i was not disappointed,0
wait until seth roasts mark for this review,1
from what i ve noticed when speaking to fans about the spiderman movie adaptations and casting there is always a substantial dichotomy between casual movie fans and dedicated fans who ve read the comics and the wide variety of media in terms of a stand alone movie with no back catolougue or previous source material i can see why folks enjoy toby s portrait of peter parker but in many ways the raimi version of peter is far from accurate to the source material i d go as far as saying maguires rendition is unrecognizable to the character of peter parker peter isn t exactly a prom king but he s nowhere near as timid unconfident and humorless as the way raimi rewrote the character what made peter so attractive and polarizing to the readers was the fact that he was not just likable but charismatic exceedingly intelligent and funny peter was so humble and down to earth but still kept his head up and did his best to fulfill his responsibilities in my opinion i d say spiderverse and the mcu adoptions seem to be the best most accurate adaptations of the character as a viewer i don t see toby maguires rendition of peter out of costume could be the same spiderman we see moments later saving lives and swining webs,1
this series is gonna give me a good reason to binge all the spidey films once again lol watched the amazing spider man films for the first time a couple weeks ago so i m looking forward to see how next week s review turns out i actually enjoyed them so it s a shame how much their high points are brushed aside by fans but i can also see why they got the reception they did,1
i remember when i was a kid and i watched spider man n time in a row the acting in these movies were amazing,1
mark please tell me you re not only doing peter parker movies and into the spiderverse will get a video tobey is my favorite pp but spiderverse is my favorite movie,1
tobey was just my favourite because i grew up watching them like i was that young i cried when they cancelled the th one,1
i also just miss the grittiness of using real people and real effects vs cgi even when the cgi is amazing i still know it s not real it s like watching of anime vs the smoothness of new mine that looks amazing it s just different and gives you a different vibe when you watch i mis the old real effects in these,0
honestly maguire is the most overrated spidey and garfield the most underrated,0
i like this style of video that doesn t have to do with an anime i hope you do more of these videos with other movies,0
nice,0
oh my god i loved tom s cameo,0
thank you for covering this,0
i ve been waiting for this my son and i are going to watch this again when he s home from school tobey is the og always will be but i still love all of them,1
don t care i prefer garfield s version overall his spider man was genuinely perfect as the comic styled smartass whereas i will admit tom nailed both peter and spiderman though tobey cried too much for me to like him villains were the highlight of the rain trilogy not venom,0
lotta stand up comedians in the trilogy and the highlight of it for me is joey diaz on the train in spiderman who said you wanna get to him you gotta get through me,1
now it smells like christmas,0
not the peak just the best we ve gotten so far,0
also i disagree with the helmet mask thing i don t think that facial expressions are necessary to express emotion what i enjoyed about spiderman was that his personality was conveyed through his body language for me body language is a nice way of showing and not telling,0
day of asking tnm to review fairy tail or at least rave master,0
no no tom get back here tom i need more amazing content,0
i am watching every spider man movie with my year old brother he has never seen any of these i m preparing him for the spider verse my ranking is the next one spider man into the spider verse far from home spider man homecoming spider man amazing spider man amazing spider man,1
the dislikes are from the daily bugle,1
damn min we are in for a treat,0
spiderman ps,0
everyone willem dafoe and alfred molina are the best actors in this trilogy me an intellectual bruce fucking campbell,0
only the live action dude into the spider verse is the best one and you need to cover it somehow,1
you re the best mark,0
i think the mask issue was just a problem for live action its way easier to emote on the mask with the animated stuff for sure,0
neet also you know the anyone can be spider man thing hope it s a theme in this spider man movie for reasons,0
i am watching every spider man movie with my year old brother he has never seen any of these i m preparing him for the spider verse my ranking is the next one spider man into the spider verse far from home spider man homecoming spider man amazing spider man amazing spider man,1
can we appreciate his use of the spiderman ps music,1
i would love it if mark made a series where he reviews all the marvel movies,1
these movies ain t perfect but the cheesiness and silliness enhance the experience so much and it fits with the spider man vibe great movies,1
cracks open a cold one let s do this,0
there was differnt live action spider man tv show you completely neglected for your poll of who makes for the best live action spiderman how dare you not include them,1
so hyped for this video edit this video was beautiful mark very personal and close to home great great work,0
spectacular will always be my spidey but love tobey,0
sorry about the spidey clips from the first two films playing only in one ear the third film ironically has no issues so hence forth i shall pretend that this was an artistic choice to balance my tone across all films,1
as much as i like tom as spiderman tobey is still the true spiderman,0
i always say as a kid i related to spider man s heroic spirit as an adult i relate to peter parker s crippling debt,1
let s go mark,0
wow what a hit of nostalgia good work team,0
don t agree with the costume thought the point of not seeing his face is the costumes point also in the early s what were they supposed to do,0
a one hour review of the three original spider man films heck yeah i haven t seen any of the films i m just aware of what s happens in every tobey andrew and tom spider man film and i have heard and seen the events the marvel movies have been through and everything so i should be good to watch no way home,0
spider man is a masterpiece,0
responsibility is cool but there s more things in life like getting your dick rode all fucking night mc ride,0
noice,0
hell yeah great work as always mark watching these right now in anticipation for nwh,0
first to spidey cember,0
this is so wonderful mark i adore your videos and i enjoy them so much it s really cool to see you review another medium spider man is my favorite superhero and the rami films still mean a lot to me i m so happy to see a wonderful review from you thank you so much,1
one of my favourite movies,0
the movie audio is entirely on right speakers idk if this can be fixed,0
man i love this films they mean so much to me,0
let s goooooo,0
tobey was the first spiderman i saw he is my spiderman no questions that doesn t mean tom holland is bad andrew garfield was pretty shit,0
one hour are you insane mark obviously i m grateful but why didn t you split it up into minute videos,0
i dedicate this comment to the guy who played flash thompson i wouldn t want to fight me either,1
i really don t understand why spiderverse doesn t get the respect it deserves just because it is animated to me is the best spiderman movie hands down,1
i urge everyone to read the original comic books the lee ditko series if you haven t they hold up so much better than you might expect and are worth every penny regardless of the medium you get them in very fun and shockingly ahead of their time,1
i find it sad that all three of these spider men still miss key elements of not only what makes spider man an amazing character but also what these films lack with their interpretations of peter parker i also think it s quite rude how much these films go out of their way to ignore the original comics from lee and ditko,1
hey mark if you are seeing this please un private your dragon ball review because you didn t maybe it was a good thing cuz you made me watch the episodes,1
as a long time spider man fan the closest i ve seen to my peter parker was into the spider verse peter b parker had me losing my shit as a s kid my peter was an adult married just coming out of the clone saga aunt may was intermittently dead and this portrayal of the character was just pitch perfect to me obligatory fuck omd,1
i think toby maguire peter is great just due to nostalgia and the films being generally good for the time but surely i cant be the only one who even as a kid thought toby looked like a grown ass man pretending to be in school xd,1
it has begun,1
yessir,0
omg lol i ve legit been working on a video like this for ages and mark manages it within a week lol,1
finally lets gooo,0
commenting to help with the algorithm,0
him yes anime spider man,0
regardless of where people stand on who s the best spider man i think the absolute worst part about the raimi trilogy is undoubtedly mary jane she freaking sucks in these movies,1

mark not reviewing anime manga dont tell harry,1
hey,0
who s here in,0
playing it in my biggest complaint is none absolutely none of the side quests doesn t really matter suits doesn t really matter skill tree is mid and gadgets have no place in boss battles like whats even the point beating up the same enemies is boring i think i played the game wrong thinking that all of the side quests had a point i should have just gone from one yellow point to another and i guess it would have been fun,0
still got my copy absolutely love this game great nostalgia to the s spidey games,0
just got around to playing this version of a spider man game and i m hooked in,1
this game was painfully overrated gameranx got this one way wrong,0
it s alright not bad slightly above average,0
when ps and spider man was non existent so nostalgic,1
bought it ps disc version brand new for i hope my ps can play it,1
this game is amazing,0
collecting collectibles is bad to me its fuller that could be used to fight other unique enemies or new idea concepts,0
am hooked,0
anyone in,1
this year run insominiac has been on and with venom wolverine and another spiderman game coming might be the greatest stretch in gaming history,1
years later playing on ps and this game is still amazing,1
i m so glad someone finally talked about the swinging from spider man ps still the best by far,1
this game is the reason i switch from being an xbox guy since to being addicted to playstation now,1
bought the remastered version for on ps i ll start it when i m home from work looking forward to it,1
and still one of the best,0
ive always been an xbox guy but my buddy is giving me his ps next week so i can play this game im so excited,0

the area clearing is my combat practice,0

mad to think how far this game has come,1
damn i m watching this for the th time after finishing the game for the th time on pc this was a masterpiece,1
i just bought it,1
me who preordered the game in platinumed it twice and did ng times on ultimate difficulty with all dlc and bought the remastered on steam watching this review like,0
bought this game years later and it s awesome i came to check this review in order to know how fair this channel is generally,0
why am i watching this for years after the game came out and after i beat the campaign because i can,1
should you pick this up or god of war,0
playing this on the playstation,0
years of your upload watching this video finally also after buying the game,0
is spider man game of the year edition the same as the reglaur marvel spider man editot on ps like graphic wise n game play wise,0
i m just about to play this for the first time excited i had a lot of fun with the early spiderman games growing up if it s not broken don t fix it,0
just bought this years later finally on sale for it s amazing,1
i personally like the face,0
yuri watanabe is a funny name,0
the good is great the bad is repetitive,0
i really enjoy the game it s fun to sit back and play as spiderman in such great detail defininetly worth the buy,0
fantastic review as always,0
wish the destruction damage done on boss mission s stayed for some while without disappearing instantly after mission,0
i dont know how people like that game i honestly dont,0
but you can t ride the subway,0
i pirated it,0
dang i was gonna buy spider man and looks like i can t because i don t agree with this joke,0
i will check it,0
oldtimer player here this game sits right next to heavyweights like the witcher mass effect and the metal gear solids for a super hero game this thing is a beast absolute reccomender,0
i want to get this but it looks like its a very very demanding game see digital foundarys review so i am going to wait and hope they can get a bit more perfomance from it i dont want my playthrough to be hindered by frame drops etc my card is good a ti but my cpu is not up to the job for this game,0
now on pc with the remastered,0
this video is the reason why i decided to pre order spiderman remastered,1
nowadays watching this review fot the upcoming pc release and i hear jake saying console exclusive haha yeah right,1
watching this before the game comes out for pc,1
excited that this is finally coming to pc next month,0
watching this after finishing everything in the main campaing and all dlc s,1
i m getting this on steam and just watching gameplay if it fills me with a joy i wish i d been able tool do it sooner,1
watching this after finishing the game,0
i feel booring on this game i try to force my self but nahh its not that amazing,1
this game is hella fun i m glad it got added to playstation plus,0
playing as mj and miles with no powers totally sucked it took up way too much of the story and i really didn t like that everything apart from that was great totally awesome game and i m super happy i m finally done with the story so i don t have to deal with that lame stuff anymore i mean it was a good story it s just that i m playing to be spider man that s the whole point,1
pov you already bought it,1
i love your vids,0
excited this game is finally coming to pc,1
i have played this game on normal and hard mode fucking love it gonna play it again anytime,0
who else came back here after they announced its coming to pc,1
beat the game and went straight for platinum i was mostly done already and just needed the suits and crimes but still,0
finally watching this as it comes to pc,1
who else is here to get ready for the pc release,1
just here coz i m excited for this to release on pc,1
i wood play it,1
camera gets stuck in a corner never experienced that and i ve beaten the game times,0
lol why this video is in king vades playlist,1
jake casually saying you should check this out me best game i ve ever played platinum the shit out of it,1
,0
should i buy it i mainly play sim games flying driving racing,1
woooo,1
before you buy this game i want you to know one thing you should buy it,1
ign spider cop was worth it,1
tbh dont buy the normal version if you can buy the remaster once you spend hours in the game some things just start to seem a bit clunky for one its the only ps game that has crashed in my ps that might just be the digital version but i really hate things in a stealth mission the auto lock function for the gadgets will make or break your stealth mission bc it kinda acts up npc enemies might sometimes get stuck in a wall and you have to spend minutes finding where tf they are and the swinging is almost perfect but you can get stuck in the corner of a building still just nit picking,0
anybody else recently did a playthru of the game again and realize they predicted covid bananas,0
watching this after buying as always,0
just got this for bucks after finishing the last of us i could use a lighthearted game like this,1
i just finished this game omg this game is so good but i hated the hide and seek thing,0
do you really need ps plus to play or play the story,0
is worth the ultimate,0
until i got around hours in i sucked so bad at thus game and would die constantly i feel like you hit a point where it finally clicks and i became almost untouchable i think it also has a lot to do with unlocking new moves and perks,0
jesus loves you so much i was addicted to porn for almost years of my life i was on drugs alcohol i hated people and i was full of jealousy but jesus set me free and he can do the same for you just call out to him ask him to save you and he will,1
i was honestly thinking of getting a playstation just for this game,0
hope imsoniac will do deadpool game after wolverine,1
wow,0
best ps game,1
tip the lower you are web swinging the faster you are but you need to know when to release it so you don t fall,1
drawjopping moments,0
i totally regretted not pre ordering this game because i was so afraid of getting disappointed because of my past experience with aaa games that i pre ordered especially from ubisoft,0
web blossom is probably the best buff it also gives you an actual reason to buy the classic repaired suit,0
the problem is that i buy the game and watch these after,0

i think if you ve ever played just cause or part of the just cause series the grappling and the web shooting are very similar when it comes to going close or far to a building to attach to only difference is that you need to use more controls instead of just pressing l and letting rico grapple to the building,0

just shut up and buy the game oujix,1
i m not even gonna play the game in just gonna swing around and run on buildings,1
already brought it but i haven t played it yet,0
this game is great and is better than arkham knight by just bc in arkham knight u fight kobra tanks ahh,1
so far i haven t bought any game,1
when you play at the highest difficulty all of the encounters are challenging and i like that,1
worth getting it for even though i have never played it nor followed any of the spider games except for the movies should i still get it,0
man i started playing this last week got it for for black friday with the dlc i m super impressed by the game it s such a perfect game to play after a long day of work you get to kick back web swing and fight bad guys,1
hah xbox took an l,0
i give this game star out of because it lets you record every single cutscenes unlike other games this game is good,0
bought a ps this black friday specifically to play this game,0
just got it for bucks with all the dlc s watching this as i wait to play,1
downloading it now,0
it took me days to end this game,1
is this game still worth buying in late i didn t get it last year,0
this convinced me to not buy the game,0
how many houres have the game only doing the main story more than h,0
this game sucks if you like quick time events and arkham city rip offs this is the game for you,0
dont buy not as good as other games its the least game i enjoyed for ps,0
im still playing this game in,1
hey i got this game yesterday from cex for pounds i just wanted to ask will the game still look good if i just play on a normal ps with a big p tv,1
that settles it it is worth buying,0
the only issue i have with replaying this game is all the mary jane miles morales missions which uh,1
i can t find it on the store i can find goty but,0
the best of me to get to know how much i love,0
super helpful thanks dude,0
wow year,1
this is my favorite game ever like ever,1
should i buy this game in or should i buy some other games in ps,0
should i buy this or days gone or god of war,1
bought the game today haven t played it yet,0
any game that is based on nyc im buying it,0
so if i buy the standard edition i have the full story of the game,0
not a bad game but definitely not the best game i ve ever played it does get frustrating later on especially when demon gangs are introduced as they become incredibly op especially the brutes when they gang up on you with a mob of shielded mobs and assault rifles firing from all directions not much fun fighting these enemies after a while when you keep getting pummeled and tbh it does get annoyingly repetitive too i ve rage quit this game several times now even though i am playing on hard but still,1
these videos spoil buying the game i feel like i ve already played the game so if i buy it i already know what to expect,0
this was literally a carbon copy of the arkham games still an enjoyable game,1
i got it yesterday and i saw this today,0
this game was one of the reasons why i bought a ps this and the show,0
the challenges was actually just a timewaster they usually are just like arkham city they were just there to make the game longer than it needed to be and after clearing out a base for the th time that became a bit repetitive as hell and also after the th street crime and when you re clearing out a base stealth is pretty much rendered useless,0
i m just happy they didn t put tom holland in this game,0
any other sad xbox players,1
just bought this it s downloading d,1
just bought it today,1
ugh when jake reviews the games i turn off,0
this is probably my most favorite comic book game ever but one thing i will say web of shadows handles air combat much better,0
i ll be honest i bought an entire ps pretty much just for this game before i even read any reviews,1
wow this guys swinging makes me feel so fast lmao,0
i finally got this game monday evening played it until my hand hurt the next day,0
before you buy get a ps thanks for reading,1
can t wait for the sequel it s going to be awesome,1
before you buy go to the store and search for it that s all you have to do,0
you can fast travel in this game,0
im not buying this game if they dont have a venom suit,0
is it on pc,0
this guy doesn t give this game enough credit it s been almost an year i still love this game,1
it s almost am and i have a urge to go to walmart and buy a ps and get this game amd god of war lol,0
i love this game,1
if you havent already bought it just buy the damn game,1
i love this game very very fun,0
is there like a free mode where you can do whatever you want,1
i sold my xbox to pay for a ps pro just to buy this game i beat it after hours of nonstop gaming and it was the best hours i spent in a video game totally worth it my xbox s sacrifice was not in vain,1
easy plat,1
games like these make the ps a good investment i bought it for the exclusives in the first place,1
just got the platinum too me days to get it easy but fun,0
literally just went and got a ps for this and god of war,1
i have to be honest i have never use photo mode in a videogame but in this one i was a fucking photographer lol is so amazing that it feels unnatural,0
just bought a ps for this game,0
addictive game,0
now if only i could afford a ps,1
still recommend,1
who s watching this after buying it,1
my daughter bought it for me as a fathers day gift i got it early of course i m really enjoying it and it looks beautiful,1
this game was too overhyped its a alright game and fighting bad guys was the same which made it boring and just web slinging was cool at first but then got boring,1
still a masterpiece insomniac nailed it can t wait for the sequel,1
wish i could play on pc,0
is it worth the hype yes get it,0
playing as maryjane ruins the game,0
this game is overrated still good but not as much as i ve heard,1
one of the best games of the last decade gameplay is tremendous casting is outstanding longevity is insane and the story is fucking unreal every time i thought i was just about finished the story they throw a shit tonne more at you fucking unreal,1
disappointed by the combat too repetitive and boss battles were boring imo,1
honestly my favorit suite is the original tobey suite,0
i am watching this while downloading,1
im in a none us region jus spent hours looking for a way to purchase the game from the psn store since its like now finally succeeded cant wait to play the game,0
good review better than ign bro gg,0
cannot emphasize its stuff you played before good game but quite overrated,0
just beat it the second time on new game plus still amazing,1
do i have to download a ps to play this,1
you buy the best way to,1
should i cop,0
for some reason this game made me feel like tobey mcguire,1
this or forza horizon,0
let me tell you something this game looks so great even on a normal fat ps,1
just bought for cant wait to play,1
before you buy no just buy it trust me it s the best spider man game you will ever play,1
hdr makes such a massive difference it s really weird seeing it without on youtube,0
can it get any better,0
one on my favourite games if no my favourite i m not even a huge marvel fan,1
spider man spider man does whatever a spider can,1
watching this gameplay reminded me a lot of prototype,0
i just want to know if this is offline or online because i don t have any wifi conection so i want to know if i can play this game without wifi or not,0
this game is amazing dlc was also pretty good,1
how can you play a game from cover to cover idiot,0
i agree with you today minutes awesome i got the game and it completely amazing i m waiting virginia right now,0
but the repetitivenes is realy fun,1
the best game since web of shadows,1
who s watching even though they don t have a ps,0
is spiderman offline,0
i need a new ps thinking about paying for the spiderman bundle any input,0
this video makes it sound as if its okay at best and that its not as good as spiderman ps,0
i cant wait until k tv s are the norm so k tv s will be nice and cheap,1
buy it,0
if you know who spider man is and you have a ps buy it simple,1
god of war or spiderman idk which to buy for my birthday any ups and downs,0
honestly this game was really ballsy with its story i was not expecting some of the directions they decided to take at all props to insomniac for not only delivering a quality gameplay experience but also a thoroughly rewarding narrative one too,1
and microsoft brought crackdown shame,1
that thumbnail photoshop is awfull,1
put a hours in this game idk how but i did,0
who cares if the fighting feels like batman batman did it right and games should copy that fighting style as long as they put their own twist into the combat,1
easily goty,0
watching this after i completed the game,1
i m about to buy a game and im between spidey ps horizon zero dawn kingdom hearts what should i do,0
already bought it already finished it finish downloaded the dlc s already playing it again now on ultimate difficulty awesome game gow red dead sitting there waiting to be unwrapped,0
best game on ps,0
dude perfect review i ain t a superhero fan but always enjoyed spidey growing up this game is a normal run of the mill open world game but its so fun,0
hells kitchen way off,0
i work a lot and have only just recently put about hours into this game and i m honestly not too thrilled maybe i just need to play a bit more to get into it,0
before you buy check if you have ps,0
isnt it kinda like prototype,0
i m almost done with the game and it is a very great game,0
um i already bought why am i here,0
buying ps with games of my choice super duper excited,0
there s so much love put into this game it really shows,0
i m watching this to get over not haveing a ps whyyyy,0
im buying this tomorrow,0
why do i always watch this after i buy the games,0
i love it although i wish the story was longer but i love the emotions of peter and the setup of sinister six fun game but i m hoping we get more marvel insomiac games like this maybe a daredevil game or doctor strange of this style,1
still waiting for them to make it for xbox,0
is this game worth buying it after finishing the story i don t like the ps vita version before if the mission is hard or tricky,0
spider man doesn t kill rip to everyone who fell hard on their necks and heads and the ones who you threw from a building after you hit the hell out of them using your heavy asf surroundings,0
too late,0
just spent on the ps just so i can play this game better be worth it,0
what do you mean before you buy games,0
it s the perfect spiderman game jake and it is very different to batman games have you not played the previous spiderman games it was released earlier than batman games and criticicizing the camera is not the game fault it s on you,0
this game looks absolutely beautiful in k,0
,0
i need help what should i get this game or red dead,0
so batman but less depressing,0
should i get it,0
i have been always a spiderman fan since day but where the creators messed up is that they didnt have it in different platform as like myself being a pc owner and an xbox owner,0
i ll save you minutes and seconds of your life just buy the game and if you don t have a ps than buy a ps,0
i ve got it it s awesome,0
so funny story i had a xbox one and i thought oh a new spiderman game then it said only ps i bought a ps just to play bit my friend had a ps and already had the game so yeah i spent dollars on a ps for game,0
i don t get the hype,0
should i buy it,0
i only own this game is beacause of the ps deal with the spiderman game,0
i hate this game its so trash because it doesn t have battle royale mode,0
who else is watching after spiderverse,0
which one is better spider man or farcry,0
this game or hitman,0
fortnite is better than spider men,0
i m not even a spiderman fan and i bought this game,0
so i ll buy it,1
just finished it the best game i played this year but by far the feature to switch off qte is the best feature about it,0
you had to unlock the jump ability after prior unlockables,0
i hope they add the skin from the old spider man series you know the one with ugly peter with a double chin and ugly hair,0
i seriously bought a ps and a tv just so i could play it worth it,0
this horizon or lost legacy,0
the one thing i don t like is that you have a limited amount of default webs,0
i need a ps,0
for a lot of people this is the first game that they percented,0
tbh the storyline was weak but the open world game play is great,0
the combat was a wakeup call i got shit on at first,0
how cool would it be if you mix spideman the game and infamous second son like del walking in nyc,0
thanks for the advice,0
i kicked a dude off a building in this game just yesterday pretty sure he is dead,0
after playing the game for a few hours not only have i completed of it but i ve also completed almost every side quest collectibles criminal activity etc as much as the game feels nice i found it to be super simple and as much as it seems open world the feel of open world is nothing more than a forza racing game where ur free roam for no reason i also found the things like the avengers tower quite disappointing as its nothing a but a stand out building in the game i ve yet to play arkham but i already see the similarity and simply dumb down version of assassins creed in this i wish there was a bit more to the game to be honest from what i ve been told its fun from the super hero fan side but from someone who is interested in open world games like skyrim fallout even gta i found this to be a little to simple my opinion obviously,0
there s a base challenge in turf war at a brewery that was infuriating one of the challenges was to get an hit combo and it get so close only to be randomly hit with rockets and or plasma gun fire by enemies silently camping from the other side of the stage out of sight it was so annoying i just had to give that challenge up my only other gripe was that i wish you could save your photos and that you could get more rewards for taking cool shots of battles like in one of the classic spiderman games,0
y all think ps has the best exclusives the polystation is a pc killer i can t wait for aquaman for it,0
i wasn t sure but now i know that i m totally getting the game,0
i love this game so much i remember playing spider man and web of shadows,0
totally worth the hype i ve been playing this game non stop lol spider cop back at it,0
buy it now watch this after,0
your color is way exagurated,0
spider man after you buy title is fixed,0
should i get spiderman it ac odessy edit or,0
should i buy this or ac odyssey i need help before the sales go down thanks,0
i m gonna need a ps this christmas,0
i can see why spiderman would win game of the year traveling is is the most fun part of this game which is hard to say for many games but also its basically batman but during the day which is amazing and beautiful optimist and cheerful,0
minor complaints very solid good game,0
rest in power stan lee,0
do not watch this before you buy just go buy it now,1
too late i already bought it,0
gameranx before you sub,0
native new yorker naw u a native californian,0
you make it sound like it s bad o,0
this game is repetitive on most parts like boss battles side quests bases not many interactions with the npcs weird faces under certain lighting etc the only thing which kept me going was the story which isn t bad at all jjj s commentary some research station missions combat and suit powers the swinging is good but ain t mind blowing the safety nets are annoying the momentum ain t fully real and there s a limit to how fast and how high spidey can go with the swinging other than that good game but repetitive it could ve been fleshed out even more but i m not disappointed since there s going to be a sequel and this being a solid spidey game after so many friggin years,0
should i get this or assassins creed odyssey pls help im so confused,0
so ign says feel like spiderman and gameranx says think like spiderman,0
i am watching this before i get spider man and my ps slim,0
i m watching this after having bought spiderman now i m just waiting on it to download hours to goooo,0
dr bob really man your boring,0
great video but your web swinging needs practice dude also spoilers that end was devastating the machine beeping as the screen goes off and then halting entirely while a bit clich d really left me speechless for a minute,0
watching this after i beat the campaign and dlc the title of this video should be why you should buy i would have liked the game to be a bit harder though there s too much radar and markers telling you where to go that s the only negative for me though,0
wow why graphics is sooo bad is this it watch dogs even more downgaded,1
this vid shouldn t exist there are no things in this game someone wouldn t like i m not even that big of a spider man fan and i still love this game,0
duuuuuuuud disss gameeeee guuuuuudd,0
anyone here who does not have a ps and watching this,0
good video but i have to say i platinumed it without ever having any camera problems,0
remember this isn t arkham aerial combat is your friend and makes combat easier there s no reason to stick to the ground while in a fight in this game you re gonna have a hard time pretending you re batman in a spider man game,0
can you eat shit while swinging around,0
is this game repetitive,0
we get it before you buy blah blah blah we get it you don t have to do the same thing every video can you switch it up,1
just bought the game but the game seems too small what s your opinions,0
is p led lg tv hz good for gaming,0
i just got it hyped,0
bet you won t pin this,0
yh but what s the story tho,0
spoiler alert spiderman eats pigeons,1
man im searching games what should i buy suggesttt,0
who else buys the game then watches these vids,0
already baught it,0
it s really good,0
what happens when you beat ut that s what i m concerned about,0
does it get boring after completing the main story,1
i would buy it for ps if i had one,0
buy this game thank me later wow is the only word,0
fun game and i m enjoying it but i have to admit it was a bit overhyped so far it s like a or an for me,0
ufc or spider man can t decide help me,0
will there be content added,0
this game costs euros in my store hell no i m not buying it i ll just wait year and buy it at half the price,0
love love love the game minus all the drama with mj and really cheesy dialogue,0
ignore the boat people we don t talk about the boat people,0
hey i want to buy this game but i think that little bit repeatative am i right,0
it is repetitive to a certain extent but not as bad as mafia iii,0
but does it make you feel like spiderman,0
spiderman ps easily surpasses sp in web swinging,0
just completed it this game is everything i ve dreamed of for the last years buy,0
is it worth to buy a new ps for it tho aaand all the other exclusives,0
women in spiderman are apparently competent enough to be faction leaders but not competent enough to fill any other positions in their organisations in order to work your way up through the ranks you have to be competent enough to handle those various lower ranking positions which the women in spiderman clearly cannot this is a very common video game clich the faction leader will be a tough as nails woman who is superior to most of the men under her but if you take the time to look at her little army you will notice that there won t be any women in sight because apparently they don t have what it takes to make the cut a little consistency is all i m asking for,1
is it just me who noticed that the colors in this video looks better than the game it self,0
who is watching while he s bought it already,0
this game mad boring,0
been looking forward to this game since it was announced bloody love it also spider armour mk ii suit for life,1
i m so happy they added the spider punk suit,1
side quests once main story is done is there any,0
spiderman doesn t worth it i wish i just save up money for ac odyssey,0
i got hours of playing this game and i am in percent,0
its fun for a few hours after that its become boring bland openworld repetitive mission uninteresting bossfight and its way too short for games,0
buying this today after seeing venom so excited can t wait,0
the vid should be called when u buy,0
my favorite suit is the scarlet spider but no ben reilly to play as also kaine parker gwen stacy cindy moon i want it a spider man clone saga story mode but that should be a sequel for the full story mode also would be nice to get the silver scarlet spider suit,1
i am watching this after i completed the game and got all the trophies was an absolutely enjoyable experience best spider man game period,0
i don t have a ps is it worth buying a console just to play spider man,0
game of the year hands down,1
fak u,0
i m too broke,0
my favourite spider man was web of shadows,0
i could of waited a few months but my little brother wanted it so i bought it and he is using it first,0
in all honesty this game isn t the holy grail that it s is made out to be overall do not feed into the marvel fanboy hype at it s best this is a good game but not much else gadgets combat very basic and repeatative not to mention how easy it is to forget about the gadgets you have which can be overpowered at times story very well done perfect blend of peter spidey collectables no grind required to get anything and once you do get what you grind for there is next to no purpose for them other than unlocking suits open world the world is as you may have expected empty although there is a small amount of missions they can seem far too repeatitive at times not to mention the world becomes entirely barren after reaching completion which can be done in almost one sit down if given enough time the only reason it rates a for me is simply because the world is jam packed with easter eggs that really make it quite enjoyable and fun to discover,1
i just bought the ps just for this game,0
that is probably one of the worst thumbnails ive seen in my life,1
i always play games on the hardest difficulty and i m so glad to say that it actually was challenging there are some very difficult enemies even just standard enemies can be hard and it feels so much like a realistic spider man experience this game is probably my second favourite of the year after god of war,1
i played it i didn t like it mostly because it s in fps and the fps drops are worse than ever,0
bro you can see inside the window s of the building s come on wtf haha,0
also i know most people hated amazing spider man the game i thought it was alright,0
spider man has always been my favorite but i don t have time to play yet hopefully real soon i want to experience this game as the act of love i m good it is,0
the story was great imo maybe a bit short but i really enjoyed the cuts and dialogue the characters had made me feel real feelings,0
watching this when just finishing the game,1
hi sir should i buy this or cod bo and do you know if you need ps plus for b and what for because if you do i wont buy i think i will get spider man,0
ok ok ok people if you haven t bought spiderman yet here s a quick warning you may get bored fast after you are nearly done with the entire game so that s about completion once you get to there is literally nothing else to do but stop crimes constantly it s really fun at first but it dies out in about days don t get me wrong i love the game but it just gets repetitive after a while hope this helps if you want to get it or not,1
i watched this min after buying,0

it s kinda expensive,0

i remember actually finding the shattered dimensions game still in its seethrough wrapper in a shopping cart we pulled up next to outside of wallmart it was a fun game and i liked its combat this spiderman looks good im gonna buy it,0
i m pretty sure spiderman did that whole dodging counter machanic first before batman did,0
wait you claim to have played every spiderman game cover to cover yet you state that the combat mechanics borrow from batman no it s the other way around batman borrowed mechanics from earlier spiderman games specifically the ones made by treyarch more specifically spiderman which predates batman,0

ive just ordered the game but as an avid witcher wild hunt fan is this going to be as good,0
i really like the simple and second intros you have i really really like them i want this everywhere,0

that is my favorite suit,0
anti ock,0
from what i heard people didn t like the tasm spider man games i loved them but this looks just like them,0
place finger here if i should buy spider man ps,1
spider man is worth a buy there s so much to do and is my favorite super hero game of all time i hope this is the start to a marvel gaming universe i m glad that this game met my expectations,0
ps xbox,0
do naruto to boruto shinobi striker before you buy,0

this might be a dumb question but i have the og ps anyone who s played this on one tell me if it runs okay i haven t used it for gaming in a while so i don t want to end up buying it for it to run bad on an old ps,0
do i really need to wait of you spoiling the game i should just buy it now,1
only flaw is no lock on in boss battles,0
theres so much detail i m astonished and if you go to almost any of the buildings and look into the windows then al most all of the rooms are different and that shows how much love went into this game so favourite games this year spider man god of war,0
waiting for ps emulator,0
there is something that is wrong that is its title there were already two games called spider man which are the og spider man and the spider man movie one and this is spider man,0
does it look good on a normal ps,0
spoiler aunt may dies you are welcome,0
would this game be fun for someone who barely knows anything about spider man,0
the gamerank intro looks like i don t feel so good but instead its i feel good,0
they didnt borrow from batman arkham man i wish people and these reviewers stop saying that lol go look at spider man that came out in and you will see batman arkham borrowed from spidey,0
but what about the puddles,0
to be honest this game is better then i expected,0
should a big ps just for this it s kinda hard to decide because i have a lot of gamestop credit and i kinda want one,0
what do you think of buying this to a year old,0
yuri s reactions to the spider cop are priceless,1
whoops too late great game love the unlock a suit from aiw,0

did you feel like spiderman,0
i love the easter eggs so much from alias investigations jessica jones rand enterprises iron fist murdock and nelson attorney at law daredevil the avengers tower the bar with no name i think is related to luke cage which would make sense since he s form harlem i just love the nod to the outside universe acknowledging that it exists and spider man isn t alone it makes the game so much better,0
fortnite,0
i honestly love it best game i own,0
you cannot stop swinging and just hang there that s blatantly false,0
this game deserves to win game of the year,0
this game is amazing spider man ps is the greatest super hero video game ever made,0
buy it,0
will this run above fps on ps,0
the period of motion of a pendulum is that the time of motion is equal to two times pi times the square route of length of the pendulum divided by the acceleration due to gravity is this the case in the game,0
what made spider man web swinging so great i never played it so,0
just got the secret photo suit and i m going to sleep cause i can t be arsed anymore which means i will carry on playing all night,0
literally and i mean literally the only game i have ever got the platinum trophy for this game is amazing,0
it looks like a prettier version of amazing spider man which i already own is it worth the cad,0
can you get the black sm suit,0
the amount of detail in this game is crazy wonderful story plus insomniac perfected web swinging it s a definite,1
dope review and i thought i d have to skip around spoilers can t wait to buy it,0
i found it short already good ride though,0
who says i am gonna buy it,0
as much as i would love to buy this game it isn t worth the price of the console i would have to buy to play it i m sure millions of people own a ps but millions more do not,0
it s a shame that it s a ps exclusive i d never pay the sony tax to play this,0
you just fucked spider man peter parker up,0
i just realized that someone has to clean up all the webs that spoder man shoots and spider silks tough as steel,0
this game was surprisingly good i enjoyed it,0
this is a spiderman arkham game and i say that in a good way this is really how spidey should be played wide array of web arsenals to use and changing style depending on the mission the stealth aspect is amazing and the brawl is even better i kept repeating base missions just to try pulling off combos and challenging myself until i can manage to go through without even taking any damage at all my only problem with this game is that it s not enough i want mooorreeeee i hope this becomes a trilogy like arkham games please please pleaseeee insomniac,0
spider cop retiring this is so sad alexa play despacito by lil pump,1
before u buy there s too many spoilers so watch out,0
is venom in the game,0
spider man before you sell your xbox,0
in demodcracy s play through the enemies don t seem to get webbed up before getting chucked off buildings,0
spiderman ps or detroit become human,1
the only question you need to ask before you buy is do i own a ps,1
lol you left her hanging at,0
this game makes me buy a ps,0
it s downloading,0
reminds me of uncharted or assassins creed,0
best superhero game since arkham city,0
i was a huge fan of the sequence featuring miles and rhino it really puts into perspective how menacing the supervillains are from a non spider man perspective,0
great job on that thumbnail,0
fuck taskmaster,0
yeah that s all good but does it make you feel spider man,0
does anyone else want to switch to ps but all your friends are on xbox,0
too late my guy already having fun,0
did anyone else notice some texture issues such as windows sidewalk etc,0
should i buy this fifa or bo,0
i ll buy it oh wait i ve got a xbox,0
the game is x better than i expected,0
glad you enjoyed the game but i have to say i never had a single moment where the camera was a problem,0
is stan lee in it though,0
just started this honestly not impressed while i dig the energy they ve brought the indoor controls are pretty bad as with any spidey title,0
not enough spider too much man,1
lmao the thumbnail,0
before you buy have me put thoughts in your head so when you play you only think of me haha haha ha good good not even gonna watch one of your videos,0
super cool i m going to get,1
i wanna get this so bad,0
it makes you feel like spiderman,0
certain video games make me nauseous do you think the constant motion in this game will do the same,0
hey eter,0
you didn t mention anything about the sections of mandatory sneak missions with m j and that morales kid not to mention the biggest failure in this game is putting that morales kid in the game as a forced way of introducing him as spiderman for the next sequel yes i sound like a racist don t care what you or anyone thinks miles morales does not belong in a spiderman game let alone spiderman spiderman has always been caucasian and should stay that way,1
finished spider man yesterday and boy was it an amazing spectacular and quite ultimate game it s so obvious that insomniac poured their soul into in it really makes you feel like spider man and it has a lot of flair the combat the traversal the quips the voice acting the costume design both for spidey and the baddies almost everything is superb the villain s motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out that s true but the story is good too at points i was left a bit scratching my head why the main villain went all batshit crazy but i pieced it together eventually what i don t completely get though is spoilers was he evil all along if you look around the lab and comment on the raft drawings and defense contracts otto has a reason for them but he isn t using the intracranial implant yet so was he planning the breakout before attaching the arms was he trying to warn peter even then that he knows he is spidey with the newspaper articles about electro fisk scorpion vulture and rhino one thing about this i loved how otto showed remorse when he threw pete from the raft his face was all torn up with pain for a split second then he went back to being doctor octopus the relationship between otto and pete was really cool and the harry twist was awesome as well i had already finished the research stations and knew something was up with harry but didn t expect him to be in that lab when you re playing with mj end of spoilers i really liked the peter parts as well this is something that rocksteady completely ignored with batman they never had parts where you are bruce true enough bruce sees himself as batman and bruce is a mask for him but still the peter parts were a good break from the action and i loved the puzzles too they emphasized that he is a scientist i liked the parts with mj and miles too it showed a different side of the world where you are two mostly defenseless people that are just trying to help nonetheless minor spoiler that ending bit between miles and pete was absolute gold not that weird d end of spoiler the side activities are an interesting part i actually really liked them sure you could say that they re repetitive but each had a story tidbit and different thing to do even the backpacks they had background info that s relatable to the world insomniac really have a visible passion for the webhead i always had tokens for suits and gadgets because i kept doing side activities since i found them fun the side quests though were a bit eh but suitable nonetheless yeah i really liked the game and i can t wait for a sequel or rather the dlcs for now also the world really feels lived in and the twist in the last act was welcome the fact that npcs talk to you in both positive and negative tones is awesome and realistic i also enjoyed perching on top of the groups of enemies and listening to their conversations,0
im buying this shit,0
ign no pizza missions don t deserves to be called a spider man game,1
i never really thought of the batman games while fighting any enemies,0
why am i watching this i finished that game last week lol,0
i have never fast traveled even once except on the tutorial where you re forced to,0
this would be useless as playing as spiderman but can you drive cars,1
jake big spiderman fan who has played every game cover to cover calls it web swinging instead of slinging,0
should i buy it likes and i buy it,1
how about the ending tho,1
superman dies,0
its not a superhero game if there isnt parts where that guy definitely didnt survive like either he died or was fire proof,0
my favourite suit at the moment is the one blackcat gives you i dunno why think it s the black and red theme its got going on,0
just buy it this is the best spiderman yet,0
before you buy spider man me no im gonna buy it its lit,0
it borrows a lot from the arkham games fight system well that s exactly what i wanted,0
what would have happened if rockstar made this video game,0
i love open world games but this is to linear for me,0
buying a playstation for dollars from my friend got it just for this,0
this game is so boring repetitive and predictable,0
i m pretty sure the arkham games borrowed most of the combat from spiderman and spiderman came out before batman just saying,0
i did not like the game that much it was normal,0
too late,0
just the totally original story was amazing,0
is it worth buying a ps though,0
i noticed you said there is some pandering is there alot of it is it up in your face all the time i used to be able to just ignore stuff like that and not let it bother me but nowadays i don t put up with it,0
before you buy more like before you donate another for a sequel easily the best superhero game i ve ever played can t wait for dlc s d,0
my favorite part of the game is that it lets you skip qtes,0
game of the year for me so far let s see how red dead goes,0
i ve got an xbox is it worth buying a playstation,0
gamer s standards are so low that when a good game comes out it s considered a masterpiece,0
honestly i got this game and i fucking love it they did so good everything is fluent and nice and don t get me started on the story it was amazing,0
so a channel called gamingbolt is stealing your guys thunder literally named their section before you buy i ll stay loyal,0
no mention about the awesome spidey motion capturing work,0
i would buy if i had a ps rip me,0
i had smile the entire time i am in the second playthrough,0
this spiderman game is a breath of fresh air,0
hey idiot it so reinvents the wheel dickk breathe,0
an we are back with before i lie with jake fagino,0
i m not buying a new system for one game i might like sorry sony but you are missing out on a lot of money,0
as someone who apparently played all of them back to back you should know the combat is an improvement on the combat from spider man not arkham,0
u can be spider man in fortnite now so no need for this,1
cul,0
this and red dead redemption is gonna kill fortnite,0
i wish this game was available on all consoles mobile etc so all spider man gamers and fans to play and enjoy it together maybe the next spider man game and other superheroes down the road and not just on ps every year,0
really wish i had a ps just for this,0
my favourite suit is the armored mkii the black and gold is just so stylish it was such a good game the combat was challenging early on but there were moments were the pacing felt abit too slow but its my goty,0
i want an iron man game just like this,1
combat isnt borrowed from batman arkham games since batman arkham games borrowed it from ps spiderman,0
but did it make you feel like spiderman,0
